By winning the summer memories's grand prize, of course. | Corberoan Calendar year 62",

    "2430": "One of the few assistants in Doctor Rinbell's laboratory—as well as one of its test subjects.\nModern bionic technology combined with the Rinbell's talents saved her life after she barely survived the Veiled Volcano Disaster, and her miraculous recovery turned her into something of a mascot for the laboratory.\nHer body is now half-organic, half-machine, and she wears a collar around her neck to ensure that those vastly different elements remain stable.",
    "2431": "A young woman whose earliest memories place her alone in the wreckage of a burning building.\nHer luck turned around when she was adopted by the owner of a cafe in New City, where her new ward taught her everything there is to know about becoming an outstanding maid.\nShe may not be the most adept combatant, but she possesses a surprising knack for piloting and can inspire her teammates when they need it most.\nOh, and she's also a hell of a cook.",
    "2432": "A former commander of the Aritan Army and a fanatic for mechanical parts.\nAita is a generous, vibrant individual whose personality is at a constant eleven.\nThis lack of restraint makes her a veritable genius when it comes to engineering mechs, but that doesn't come without certain drawbacks—namely, that a lot of her grand ideas are actually incredibly dumb.",
    "2433": "Captain of Queen Lilian's Guardian Knights from a noble family.\nMargaret's virtuous nature shimmers whether she is on or off the field, and though she holds a certain distaste for the weak, she could never leave those in need to fend for themselves.\nShe is indeed the embodiment of true chivalry.\nSurprisingly, she has shown a ladylike and soft side in day-to-day living.",
    "2434": "The Dark Star Witch and one of the four matriarchs of Hexel.\nGiven her particular talents, Favia is responsible for carrying out the more unsavory tasks—such as confronting criminals and assassinating would-be enemies.\nThrough it all, though, she works tirelessly to bring the Steel Witch's ideals to completion.\nAs a woman of few words, she rarely appears unless specifically called, always lurking in the dark for Noctris's protection.",
    "2435": "There is no one who tickles the ivories quite like this world-renowned Hexeli pianist.\nHer delicate fingers flow against the keys with so light a touch that one must wonder if there ever was another human so elegant.\nNo matter the song's complexity, she plays with a depth that resonates through the entire audience.\nHer grace is not confined to music—when she takes to the battlefield, it's like watching a dance of the utmost beauty.",
    "2436": "A skilled combatant with a fighting style as mysterious as her past.\nShe might seem quiet and normal when, in reality, she's restless and constantly finding the next interesting or unusual thing to desperately plunge into.\nThere are only two things anybody can say for sure about Kobayashi: that she can't get food down without downing a glass of water, and she likes to wear black and white clothes and mech suits.",
    "2437": "A mysterious girl who emerged from within the Corbero Pit.\nShe has ignored all attempts at communication, instead she's content to simply observe her surroundings.\nIndeed, she regards the scenery with an odd serenity every day before promptly disappearing into the pit's depths with the setting sun.",
    "2438": "A popular net streamer and proud member of the Health and Happiness Sisterhood.\nIn Shyaditty's mind, missions are no reason to delay a stream, and so she's often seen reporting live to her adoring fans even in the midst of danger.\nIn fact, some think she rushes into danger just to boost her viewer count. At this rate, her teammate Murasaki may have to start dyeing all those gray hairs.\nThough she may look like a D-cup on camera, it's only because she pads her natural A-cups to hell and back.",
    "2439": "One of the first success stories in the empire's pursuit of artificial intelligence.\nWhile there are no immediate flaws in her combat performance, α-16 lacks proper emotions and requires more effort to communicate with than a human soldier.\nAs a combat unit, however, her skill and efficiency are second to none, which makes it more than worthwhile to put in the extra effort.\nWhen off duty or not undergoing maintenance, she prefers to \"sleep\" inside her pod.",
    "2440": "The spiritual pillar of the Hexel Union's matriarchs, known (partially in jest) as the Orchestral Witch.\nWhether managing her colleague's work needs or navigating their emotional problems, she's never off the clock.\nGiven the trust others place in her and her own keen eye for people, she has an amazing knack for uncovering everyone's secrets.\nShe finds cleaning rather enjoyable and likes sweeping and scrubbing all day long.",
    "2441": "One of the empire's greatest scientific minds.\nRinbell's main study is the genetic dissecting and merging of humans with machines and organic creatures—mollusks being her favorite.\nThis has become the focus of nearly all her research.\nAnyone who disrupts her concentration is promptly sent to a special room where they are forced to participate in experiments of an unspeakable nature.",
    "2442": "Doctor Rinbell's personal assistant and number one stalker.\nAlthough her physical fitness and cold demeanor make her well suited for working in Rinbell's lab, her unhealthy love for the doctor does sometimes cause... issues.\nIn addition to overseeing the doctor's professional and private life, Nizzy records all of Rinbell's actions throughout the day via careful observation and a troublingly complete network of hidden cameras.",
    "2443": "No one seems to know exactly how or when this mysterious girl appeared among the Hexeli witches—no more than they can explain the unsettling tentacles protruding from her skull.\nAll they can say is that she may have the ability to communicate with animals, and she's able (and eager) to eat anything she gets her hands on.\nLiterally anything.",
    "2444": "The adjutant to Arita's Supreme Commander Morgan.\nMillyna was raised with a delicate, feminine lifestyle, so he's always worn women's clothing since he was young.\nHe is an earnest worker, but he does make the occasional careless mistake when he gets ahead of himself.\nStill, it's nothing an afternoon break and some soothing music won't solve.",
    "2445": "It's the magical girl!\nAmber dresses the part of this imaginative role, keeping her cotton candy hair in adorable pigtails, wearing an adorable pink dress, and carrying an adorable wand.\nAll of these things help cultivate the image of a true magical girl like the ones from those anime cartoon things.\nAlthough she loves cosplay and binge-watching anime, she does not consider herself an \"otaku.\"",
    "2446": "A girl who was discovered floating in a pod at the Shedd Institute by Aita and her team.\nShe rarely expresses emotion and doesn't speak much outside of brief philosophical discussions.\nShe looks as though she's always on the verge of falling asleep, but she perks right up when expressing her yearning for the outdoors—particularly the sea.",
    "2447": "One of the founders of Arita's army during Imperial War I.\nHer impeccable leadership skills and comprehensive knowledge of military affairs made her a natural fit for the position of commanding officer, but she has never once let this go to her head, and was considered \"the normal one\" among the commanders back then.",
    "2448": "Twins who make up the musical duo known as Aperi.\nThey adore their career path as idols, reveling in their ability to inspire others and melt even the coldest hearts with music.\nMuch of their music was created specially to rouse the Aritan Army.\n",
    "2449": "The infamous Shortstuff Slayer and Minister of Keghan Intelligence.\nIt should come as no surprise that a girl who looks like a cat sports a fickle temperament, which often has her clawing at anyone foolish enough to comment on her height.\nThen again, she doesn't like to talk much even to people she does like,\nmaking the list of conversations that don't end in a mauling a bit... short.",
    "2450": "A former Keghan slave who fled to Hexel.\nFinding herself at death's door, she asked Sumora to perform a risky experiment on her—one which managed to save her life,\nalbeit with some rather unique side effects.\nShe has a particularly keen interest in the black meteorite and is always among the first to volunteer when a chance to study it arises.",
    "2451": "The unsung criminal investigator, Trang, is here to take the case!\nShe will gladly hear just about any investigative request you have...provided it's not some script pulled out of a crime drama.\nThose are just not raw and real enough to entertain her.\nShe also gets very bored when her cases finally go to court—since few things are as raw or dramatic as a final verdict.",
    "2452": "A talented member of Kegha's border security. When she's not on the clock, Vivine spends her time working on a fantasy novel of her own. With language constantly on the brain, she's developed a habit of reading a little too much into the way people choose their words. While she is fond of the debates this can sometimes spur, she is just as fond of listening to others and taking their advice.",
    "2453": "A woman who can play the part of an unassuming person well, insisting she isn't worth anyone's notice or consideration.\nIn truth, she loves nothing better than to delight in the aftermath of her dark deceptions.\nIt would be no exaggeration to say she loves playing with fire—both literally and figuratively.",
    "2454": "A magician with a knack for tricks involving props or the deck of cards that she always keeps on her person.\nHer lively and sincere personality lends a certain wonder to her performances, making her quite the talent in her chosen field.\nReliable as she is, she has a tendency to behave in a way that's rather...confusing.\nThankfully, her performances always seem to have a happy ending.",
    "2455": "Alexa's aide and a girl whose seemingly reserved nature hides a dark and devious soul.\nWhen she's not busy terrorizing people, she likes to collect yo-yos and practice her tricks—though she does hold both hobbies in equal esteem.",
    "2456": "Hunter No. 37 within the Aritan Bounty Hunters' Guild and the top bounty points earner among her colleagues.\nLeigh is on the hunt for the person who killed her father—and isn't the slightest bit afraid of leaving a trail of corpses in her wake.\nShe is, quite frankly, off her rocker.",
    "2457": "Sumora Designer, head of the Designers' family and—rather unsurprisingly—a highly reputable producer who creates machines as part of her family's trade.\nShe lost her right arm during a war and had it fully replaced with a mechanized one, but she doesn't seem particularly bothered by this development.\nIf anything, she regards it as a small price to pay for the relative peace Hexel now enjoys.",
    "2458": "A well-known general who was sent to the front lines during Imperial War I and later transferred to quell Kegha's rising rebellion.\nShe continues to serve the empire to this day, but she also uses her rank to do some clandestine work on the side—work that might be related to a certain black meteorite.",
    "2459": "A girl whose unusual eyes have often left her ridiculed and ostracized. \nWithout a family to raise her, she resorted to petty theft to survive.\nShe never minded the lifestyle, though—save for the time her capture resulted in being cuffed in seemingly unbreakable manacles.\nStylish an accessory as they are, she is currently looking for a way to unlock these burdens .",
    "2460": "A childless, six-time widow after every husband died under mysterious circumstances.\nJasmine was a former Keghan soldier-turned-mercenary whose natural power of seduction left her with no shortage of suitors.\nShe looks rather harmless and tender-hearted,\nand hates any creatures with tentacles.",
    "2461": "A zombie born of the empire's many failures in human experimentation. \nShmily rules the abandoned Michael's Prison after a massive imprisoned zombies riot years ago.\nNow she spends her days fending off a boredom in her prison. \n",
    "2462": "An Aritan citizen who was captured by the imperial army in wartime and underwent a series of inhumane experiments.\nShe escaped through a mere stroke of luck, and while she dreams of one day returning to the life of an ordinary girl, her first act upon coming home was to fight against the horrors she underwent as a soldier.",
    "2463": "An imperial combat weapon with exceptional piloting abilities.\nCreated to serve only as a tool for war, she lacks basic education, cannot understand normal emotions or the concept of death, and falsely believes the respect others hold for her as a machine is equal to friendship.\nIt IS adorable how her miniature size means she needs assistance to enter a cockpit and can't be seen once inside,\nbut it is NOT adorable how her critical absence of humanity makes her an absolute monster on the battlefield.",
    "2464": "A black market merchant with connections all across the continent and beyond.\nShe goes by the nickname Lilith, preferring to keep her birth name a secret, and uses her mechanized eye to scan both goods and people alike.\nShe refuses to say whether it has an X-ray function, citing it as a trade secret.",
    "2465": "A noblewoman whose refined upbringing shows in every facet of her personality, from her sophisticated manners to the irresistible lilt in her voice.\nShe loves nothing more than to engage others in conversation,\nparticularly with people whom she's fond of—and for this masterful charmer, that means women.\nShe also adores children, yet the expression she wears when watching them is difficult to discern.",
    "2466": "A mechanical being created by some of Kegha's greatest scientific minds and technologies.\nShe has an exceptional ability to pilot mechs due to the enhancements made on her body, but without strict instruction, she will not lift a finger.\nDespite a seemingly nonexistent will and the literal, dry way she responds to orders of any sort, she was given not a serial number, but a human name: Lollar.",
    "2467": "The Black Jester's accountant and a lover of money, money, and money.\nShe takes the group's financial matters so seriously that everything else falls through the cracks.\nThat includes her physical appearance—like her long, unkempt hair, which could really do with a serious brushing.",
    "2468": "The former supreme mechanic of the Blacark and designer of the Phoenix series.\nHer youthful physique would be impressive for those even half her age.\nMechanical engineering is the name of her game, and there are few in this world who can polish rust into royalty like she can.",
    "2469": "Dignified. Dedicated. Disciplined.\nThese are but a few words used to describe Taysia, a well-educated woman descended from a line of noble swordsmen.\nAs one would expect from a woman her background, she has passionately trained in the way of the sword.\nHer other passion lies in horses, and she spends a great amount of time on her private farm cultivating her horseback riding skills.",
    "2470": "A fortune teller who most often divines the future through tarot cards, though she employs plenty of other methods in an equally capable fashion.\nViola believes that maintaining a sense of mystery comes part and parcel with her profession, and—true to her pride—she works tirelessly to elevate the reputation of fortune telling beyond the sullied station to which so many shameless fraudsters have reduced it.",
    "2471": "This version of Evelynn gained consciousness soon after her digital body was integrated with the main system.\nWhen the main host of the internal system left, it triggered a glitch in its overall function, forcing her to remain incomplete.\nShe supports Coral, her only true friend after having made an enemy of the Digital Realm, and wishes to find a way to help her return to a normal life.",
    "2472": "After countless trials and hardships,\nEvelynn has finally regained her physical body. She's accompanied by Coral, who—though still a digital being herself—is able to project into the real world thanks to the bracelet Evelynn wears.\nStill, she's just happy to finally be able to meet some of Evelynn's new friends.\nThe hardships these two have faced together left them with a bond unlike any other.",
    "2473": "One of the four matriarchs of Hexel, known across the continent as the Calamity Witch.\nTo Solar, breaking into an impregnable fortress is simply a fun way to pass the time, and she delights in finding powerful opponents to crush into the dirt—regardless of whether or not they are actual enemies of Hexel.\nAlthough she's extremely rash and hot-tempered, she tends to behave herself around Noctris.",
    "2474": "A pair of sisters whose knowledge of ancient technology is only matched by their ignorance of modern tech.\nStill, they're eager to learn and find their place in this strange world.\n22 is cheerful, enthusiastic, and always eager to help her little sister—sometimes even to the point of being overprotective.\n33 tends to be rather quiet and withdrawn, but she's a skilled programmer.",

Upon realizing there was a better way to deal with your many requests, she started to rely on her automated admin system more—leaving her free time to explore whatever might strike her fancy. In short, she became incredibly efficient at being lazy.\nStill, her actual skills and performance as an AI are flawless, especially given how she completes these automated tasks far faster, which makes her almost peerless.\nPerformance aside, she's started picking up certain... habits from her research into human behavior and the mysteries of life. You're not exactly sure where these new personality traits come from—games and anime may be strong candidates—but at some point she learned how to complain about everything, especially you.\nAt this point, she seems destined to become some kind of virtual NEET who can only be bribed to come out of room with snacks.",

It was there that her experience with machinery and knack for gathering intelligence shined brightest, and she quickly earned an excellent reputation.\nBut even her skills couldn't prepare her for the cruelty of war. The resistance was quick to buckle against its adversaries, and Veronica alone was no match for the forces sent to kill them. As she waited for her life to flicker out, something unexpected happened: she was saved. By the Blacark mercenaries led by you. After that, joining your ranks felt almost like a matter of course, though it came as a shock to learn her vibrant savior was still considered a newcomer.\nWith the civil war, Arita's battle against the empire, the founding of Hexel, a declaration of peace, and enrollment in the Blacark Mercenaries, Veronica has been at the heart of countless world-shaking events. While this might force any ordinary person into an early retirement, Veronica has instead used them to create a sprawling information network—an ideal asset as a freelancer. She's become a bit of a wanderer, but those who've earned her trust can always find her via the right channels.\nAlso, she apparently likes wearing various animal ears atop her head as a self-proclaimed token of admiration for their sensitive hearing.

But one cannot crack the \"unsolvable\" cases that fill her dossier without forging connections with some rather powerful people—people like Supreme Commander Morgan of Arita and Noctris of Hexel. With such allies only a call away, it's small wonder that her enemies rarely last.\n\nYou and Kristina first crossed paths while she was working on a request to investigate what she describes as \"puppets\". She initially took on the request out of curiosity, but quickly realized that joining you was a surer path to even more interesting cases. She still works on that original case whenever she has time but will drop whatever she's doing to join your latest adventure—her words, not yours.

And an unknown is exactly what she is.\nShe lurks around her mercenary unit, usually doing things without apparent reasons; missions in factories and laboratories make her breathing unsteady; she possesses an interdimensional, utterly incomprehensible space—a rift of some unnatural origin—to store collected weapons and screws. Naturally, new rumors about her seem to spring up every day. Some even believe she was born before the Sundering, a day that must have taken her home, her family...even her past. After all, what else could explain a girl with no name, memories, or even emotions?\nIt was only after meeting Haela that the lost, nameless girl could begin living once more. When Haela proposed finding whoever was responsible for the changes made to her—since she had certainly not been born this way—a fire was lit in the young woman's frozen heart. Since that moment, she has worked tirelessly to reclaim everything she lost.\n\"Illeheath\" might be just a code name, but until her trickling memories return in a torrent, it is all she has.

She more than lives up to the nickname 'Valkyrie'—much to the horror of her enemies. No matter how bloody things get, though, she insists she's only there to keep you safe, which is itself a little... worrying. Still, her talent on the battlefield is undeniable.\n\nShe stuck around and helped you even after the original Blacark mercenaries disbanded, but at some point she ran off and became a bounty hunter while you weren't looking. Given her job, her best course of action would realistically be to come after the bounty on your head; however, it seems staying close her has actually kept all of the other bounty hunters off your back.

While many of these plans are incomprehensibly complex, some are as simple as putting on a witch's hat and snapping some cute photos (true story). In fact, she has mountains of cute girl photos saved on her computer, and one of her fondest dreams is to one day add a photo of her idol, the Steel Witch, to her collection.\n\nAlthough she may constantly complain and lacks motivation for anything beyond girls and games, she's ultimately a reliable person when the chips are down—like, really, truly down.

She was dubbed the Chaos Witch after the chaos theory, and while she understands why she was given the name, her dislike of open-ended theories in general means this pseudonym is hardly her first pick...\nChilino is known for being friendly and easygoing, traits she readily discards when someone deliberately damage any of her test models. As a result, she's usually able to act as the balancing factor amongst the other witches, and often quells conflicts between the more headstrong witches like Solar and Noctris.\nEven if she's always the one putting a stop to it, there's a part of her that enjoys their bickering—after all, life just wouldn't be the same without it.\nShe's supposedly quite beautiful beneath her messy long hair, old-fashioned glasses, and oil-stained clothes, but your odds of seeing her transformed into an astonishing beauty in makeup and heels are effectively zero. Given her fashion sense, though, Chaos Witch might be a more apt nickname than she would ever admit.\n",

Eventually she could no longer stand to watch the cruelty of nobles obsessed with lording their status and power over the downtrodden. Vowing to tear down this system of oppression and change it for the better, she relinquished her title and left the empire. She would help bring about a fair world, not as a noble or a politician...but as a soldier of Arita.\nNow a defector of the empire, she lives as a normal woman with neither authority nor status—just the way she likes it.

Her teammates have even taken to treating any trip she makes as a forecast of rain—and more often than not they're right. A lifetime of bad luck left Zoi focusing exclusively on the negative, which only attracted more misfortune. As she wallowed in the depths of this vicious cycle, she realized something: if bad things happened to her because she expected them to, then the opposite might also be true. Changing her pessimistic attitude would be difficult, but she began obsessively exercising in the hopes of getting fit and at least restoring her lost confidence.\nShe's now a huge fan of long-distance running, and her hard-earned physique has allowed her to gain a significant amount of combat experience—an unexpected but highly appreciated bonus.

They moved from the outskirts of one town to another, each time finding themselves more worn down and destitute than before. Although her mother worked whatever odd jobs she could find to support them, it just wasn't enough.

Not that they're wrong, of course—just a bit rude.\nJessie has a penchant for cosplay and collecting antiques, both of which have propelled her into many long treks across the desert without food or water. How someone who puts no effort into caring for her body's basic nutritional needs—let alone actually exercising—can remain in such good shape is a complete mystery, and not one Jessie has any interest in solving.\nA straight shooter down to the bone, Jessie's emotions are plain as day to anyone she meets. As such, it was impossible for her to hide how deeply she was affected when one of her predecessors—someone she had admired and learned quite a lot from—was dismissed for shooting and killing a prisoner mid-inspection. Unable to stomach the betrayal of her fellow officers, Jessie left her life in the desert behind.\nEventually, Jessie found herself stationed in New City as a member of Commander Grave's Aritan Army, where she served alongside Aita until its dispersal.\nAfter her stint in the army, Jessie returned to the desert, finally comfortable resuming a life without answers—that is, until she got wind that Aita had returned. Now a little older and a little wiser, Jessie has once again set out to find the truth behind that fateful day.\n",
    "2751": "One of the matriarchs of Hexel and more commonly known as the Endtime Witch, Bathtory is a genius in both scientific endeavors and military strategies, often crippling her enemies before the battle has even begun. \nBathtory has been friends with Noctris since both were children, and begrudgingly allows the other witch to call her by the nickname \"Bae\". In turn, Bathtory is one of the few people in Hexel who calls Noctris \"Tris\" without suffering retribution. Thanks to their long friendship, the two know each others' quirks better than anyone else, which has often led to Noctris stepping in to mediate when Bathtory loses her temper—a common occurrence gave her low tolerance for fools. Whenever Bathtory's compulsive need to correct others rears its head, her longtime friend is quick to arrive and ease tensions with a smile.\nBathtory holds nothing back when it comes to arguments involving scientific theories and is quick to dismiss anything she deems illogical. This mindset allows her to approach warfare with a focus on efficiency. Her plans are methodical in the extreme, allowing enemies and allies alike few opportunities to ruin them. Though this makes her a terrifying opponent, one still has the slim chance to secure their survival should they effectively argue its merit.\nPlease do not point out how she begins sentences with \"In theory...\" as she is already working to break this habit. Regrettably, progress has been nonexistent.\n",

With her elite education and natural genius, there was nothing she could not do—be it exhibiting ladylike mannerisms, performing tea ceremonies, perfecting the martial arts of her predecessors, or studying modern arts like piloting mechs, she excelled at anything and everything she set her mind to.\nAnd yet despite her immense talents, her peers were more impressed than envious. She was never anything but graceful to those around her, with not a single person able to recall a time when she had complained about others or the difficulties she faced as a result of her upbringing. And yet, as her abilities soared past those of anyone else in her hometown, something within her began to change. She began to feel... empty. It was a new feeling, and one she couldn't shake no matter how much she trained or focused on her lessons. She realized the only way to discover what she was missing would be to go on a journey—to find someone who could match her strength and finally fill the emptiness of her aching heart.\nSo it was that Aya's travels eventually led her to enter the famed Empire's Choice Tournament, where she won with the same effortless grace she had come to expect and dread. Her prize: to become the queen's personal bodyguard. But as much as she had admired the position as a child, it now only fed the emptiness within her heart. As news of peace across the continent spread, she realized she would never find a worthy opponent. And so she resigned herself to her fate, ending her journey. Only time will tell if she will one day realize that it is not a worthy opponent she desires, but a friend who can understand what it means to always be \"perfect.\"",

With no way to undo the damage that had been done to the girl's body, Doctor Rinbell took her in and saved her life the only way she knew how—human remodeling.\n\nThe name \"Memay\" was given by Doctor Rinbell after the whole ordeal was over, her old name lost along with countless other memories to her unspeakable trauma. Despite this, she wears the moniker with pride and adores Rinbell with all her heart—even to the point of volunteering for experiments that would be far too dangerous for normal humans. Rinbell initially allowed this only on the condition that she wore a protective collar, but Memay grew to love the accessory so much that she wears it even outside of the laboratory.\n\nShe was once rather reluctant to talk to strangers—which is to say, anyone who wasn't Doctor Rinbell—but now can be bribed into friendship with food. She has also grown quite close to the many creatures that wander the laboratory, and even lets them curl atop her head or cling to her limbs as she works. Is it simply because they like her, or have they found a kindred spirit in another test subject? Regardless, it's obvious she missed the \"do not\" part of \"do not bring test subjects to other parts of the laboratory\"—not that anyone has the heart to tell her to stop.",

Though her techniques were on the very cusp of perfection, her wild nature was simply too much to be considered as a leader.\nAfter all, someone who might act unpredictably in even routine situations is a poor fit for the responsibilities of leadership.\nThis all changed during a fateful imperial attack against New City. Helena had been deployed on a mission to disguise a suicide as an accidental death. Believing it to be a solo mission, she acted with her usual recklessness... only to discover that her comrades had been given orders to eliminate her.\nShe managed to survive their attack, but just barely. Shocked and with nowhere else to go, she disguised herself as a maid and disappeared into the crowds of New City, where she eventually settled into the new—and very different—life of working in a cafe.\nBut just as she was beginning to feel comfortable in her new life, the imperials attacked New City, and the cafe was destroyed. She dragged her battered body through the ruins of her second home, succumbing to total despair as even her last sliver of hope was crushed. Piece by piece, the memories of her previous life—commanders and training, missions executed and missions failed, mistakes made and lessons never learned—faded away, leaving her clinging desperately to the one thing that remained: her name.\nAt that moment, Helena's old persona vanished. Confused, alone, and grievously injured, what remained of the brash assassin could do nothing but lie in the burning wreckage and wait for death. But as she closed her eyes, a savior arrived—Aita, a member of the Aritan Army. Seeing Helena's maid uniform, Aita decided to bring her along to do the housework Aita couldn't be bothered to. Helena was simply grateful for another chance, and immediately agreed. \nHelena now lives the honest life of an ordinary maid, and though she still has no memories of her previous life, dark hints as to who she once was continue to haunt her. She doesn't yet understand why people she has never met are after her life, but the vicious side of her that only awakens when she pilots a mech seems to be an ominous clue. Still, if it were up to her, she'd just as soon be left alone to continue improving her skills as a maid—a luxury she's unlikely to get.",
    "2756": "Throughout her childhood, Aita filled the void where her family should have been with a love for all things tech. Forced to fend for herself, she designed and sold small knickknacks and inventions. Her natural talent soon blossomed into a burning passion, a love that only deepened when she was given the chance to live at a workshop in New City. It was there, in the midst of a fresh war against the empire, that she developed her very first mech.\nTo Aita, war meant unlimited resources. She would battle imperial mechs by day, then salvage their parts for her own mech by night. But no matter how many improvements she made, her mech was little more than a tech demo without someone equally skilled to pilot it—a lesson she learned when an imperial invasion managed to seize her precious project. However, the loss of her mech led Aita to Commander Grave of Arita, whose mech she piloted to aid the beleaguered commander. When all was said and done, she was granted permission to continue using Grave's mech on one condition: that she become a commanding officer in the Aritan army.\nAita now operates a workshop of her own in New City, and though she's lived through the horrors of war, she still carries the same childlike wonder and fascination with machines she had as a child. Indeed, though the bounty hunting she does on the side does wonders for her image, she'll be the first to admit she only does it for the parts it affords her...regardless of whether she actually needs them or not. Her companions maintain that most of her hoard just ends up collecting dust, but she insists every one of her many, many spare parts is just waiting for the perfect project.\n",

When the chance to follow that dream arrived, she seized it with both hands, eager to prove herself and her ideals—and prove herself she did. Her clear-headedness and dignity quickly earned a position as the personal guard of the princess at just twenty years old. Rather than letting this lofty accomplishment go to her head, she continued to fight for the weak and downtrodden, regardless of their social status. In time, her gentle air, honest spirit, and unshakeable faith earned her the position of captain of the Guardian Knights.\nMargaret has always vowed to aid those in need, no matter how injured she may become in the process. And yet beneath her perfectly crafted mask of chivalry lies the soul of one who admires the strong and holds nothing but contempt for the weak—not the physically weak, but those who are frail of the heart. Should she meet someone who has already given up and given in to despair, her first instinct is to prove them right by abandoning them. Margaret goes to great lengths to hide this tendency from others, all the while praying that it's but a childhood flaw she can one day overcome.\nIn addition to her official duties, Margaret firmly believes that a true knight should never burden another with tasks she can perform using her own two hands. She therefore does not shy away from household chores like cleaning her quarters and washing her clothes, and as a result has become an expert at many small chores other knights consider beneath them.\n",

Although she spent most of her early days in a small dark room, she still remembers this time fondly. The kindness of her fellow assassins and the sense of purpose she gained from training in the art of killing were a welcome departure from the desperation of her youth, and the silence of the tiny room she called home was a comfort she came to look forward to at the end of every training session.\n\nAnd yet despite all this, Favia never felt as if she truly belonged among the other corps members. Sure, she was talented and quiet—both excellent qualities in her line of work—but the feelings of loneliness and isolation ate away at her until she began to lose sight of her purpose. Just as she was on the brink of despair, Favia met someone who would change her life forever: Noctris, the Steel Witch. Although their encounter was fleeting, the warmth Flavia sensed from the other woman stirred something within her—an ember of affection that smoldered even after the witch became her target. At that moment, Favia made a decision to forget her orders and everything she was taught. For as long as she lived, she would follow and protect Noctris.\n\nFavia barely speaks, only when it's necessary—like during a mission or giving sarcastic comments. Her loyalty to Noctris is unshakable—not even by death itself, for she is deeply attracted by her positivity. ",

This lifestyle has enabled her to experience nearly every inch of the continent, from its furthest coasts to the deepest caverns—and even the technologically advanced Ark Empire, a feat few can claim. But no matter where she travels, her beautiful compositions never fail to bring anyone lucky enough to hear her play to tears. This includes several important officials and dignitaries, all of whom are proud to count themselves among her contacts after hearing her splendid performances.\nAnd yet despite the superlative nature of her music, she herself is in many ways its superior. Her beauty, intelligence, and athleticism have earned her more than a few fans, and one region in particular has gone so far as to refer to her as a goddess. Indeed, seeing her perform with a graceful air that transcends human nature itself seems to justify the title.\nYet it is her proximity to perfection that distances her from humanity. This is not to say that Elizabeth is wicked or inhuman—only that her experimentation with alternative uses of piano wire has led to some rather...macabre discoveries. Most disturbingly, her apparent skill at using them to flay objects.

It's not uncommon for her to immediately challenge the winner of a duel, but she is just as content to simply watch and learn from others. Her sharp eyes and abundance of raw talent make her a quick learner; she can see a technique just once before mastering it just for kicks.

Although she might hate this restriction, every single one of her friends is immensely grateful for it. That's not even an exaggeration—literally all of them.\nExciting camera angles and buzzworthy action shots are where it's at for this obsessive streamer. She isn't just on the lookout for trouble—she dives into it headfirst while screaming \"CANNONBALL!\" At that point, it usually falls to Murasaki (AKA her knight in shining armor and her big crush) to save her from waves of artillery fire while another teammate repairs the mech she totaled. Again.\nFortunately, most of her allies don't really mind her boisterous personality and proclivity for finding trouble. Although her shenanigans often end in disaster, none of her messes so far have been beyond the sisterhood's capabilities to repair. Her friends consider her an honorary mascot second only to Snowy, and as for her fans... Well, Shyaditty delights in spoiling them rotten with her looks and voice, but since she isn't quite as confident in the size of her natural breasts, she makes sure to give 'em that extra bit of oomph during streams to show her appreciation. Fan service and all that, you know.\nSomeone in the government suggested using her as one of its advocates. The questions of who, why, and what the heck they were thinking remain a complete mystery, as Shyaditty and secrets don't exactly mix well. Or at all, really. It ultimately took an audacious young intern to point out that the only thing worse than a dimwit who knows too much, is that same dimwit...but with an audience. They ordered her to be \"taken care of,\" but she was rescued from peril by none other than Murasaki.

Worse still, even mission orders have to be issued in a very specific way; misspeak even a single word, and there's no telling what the ruthless killing machine will do. For example, she was once stuck in the massive Corbero Pit for hours after being given coordinates that were ever-so-slightly off. As for the superior who had issued those coordinates—well, that's a story for another day.\nBut don't be fooled into thinking the nascent technology that forms her foundations makes α-16 unsophisticated. Far from it—as an artificial human, α-16 places tremendous priority on maintenance to ensure her body remains in pristine condition. Unfortunately, the constant scans and tweaks to her components may have resulted in an unintended and bizarre side effect: hating maintenance. No one is quite sure how she manages to express displeasure with such a boring, routine process without an emotion mod, but the development of artificial intelligence is an ever-advancing field with far more questions than answers. When off duty or not undergoing maintenance, she prefers to \"sleep\" inside her pod. This, too, is a puzzling action her creators cannot explain.",

According to reports, Noctris once commented on Mama's self-given title by saying, \"I'm just glad she didn't go through with calling herself the Mommy Witch.\"\n\nMama always speaks in a slow, deliberate tone that, together with her ever-present maternal aura, can instill either the warmest feelings of comfort...or outright terror. After all, there are few things more horrifying than the quiet fury of a mother who's been disobeyed one too many times—a lesson the witches of Hexel learned the hard way. Mama owes this influence to her love for housework, which has led her to discover many secrets whose owners would rather keep hidden—much to Mama's delight.

Even as a member of the empire's highly-esteemed Imperial Institute of Research, Rinbell stood out as a cut (or several) above the rest, and her talents earned her a record number of promotions in a shockingly brief time. She was able to use her position to request an independent research lab hidden deep within the forested mountains...and then promptly disappeared inside the moment construction finished.\n\nThe empire is desperate for her help in developing the weapons and technology of the future, but Rinbell prefers to use her lab to further her own research into the hybridization of humans, animals, and machinery. Free from prying eyes and stifling regulations, the young professor now spends a worrying amount of time dissecting and piecing together test subjects, creating bizarre creatures as fodder for her obsessive research. Though she carefully raises many of these creatures in her own bedroom, she has no qualms with augmenting their bodies as they grow older, resulting in disturbing fusions of flesh and machine that often end up roaming the laboratory. Despite her many, many critics, her experiments have thus far escaped any judgment from the empire, which has deemed her ability to provide technological resources more important than the ethical implications.\n\nAs for Rinbell herself, she prioritizes her research above all else, especially when it comes to insignificant things like \"eating enough,\" \"wearing lab-appropriate attire,\" or \"sleeping literally ever.\" As a result, she leaves most of the day-to-day lab tasks to her capable assistant Nizzy.

She even tests all of the imperial combat machines at each stage of their development, making her a flawless combatant with complete command of the latest technology.\nNizzy is top-tier in a great many fields, but when it comes to her fixation with the doctor, she is truly peerless. After her daily tasks—scheduling and holding meetings, managing the lab's contacts, testing new tech, and handling business operations—are complete, Nizzy follows closely behind Rinbell and records the doctor's actions in a private diary. Whatever slight details she might miss in person are caught and recorded during the review phase, where she goes through the footage captured by the many hidden cameras she has placed throughout the laboratory. Though none of this is a secret, not a single soul actually has the courage to read her diary's contents.\nRinbell abhors having her work disturbed, so while Nizzy cherishes their interactions, she does her best to respect the doctor's wishes. On the rare occasion that she crosses a line, she is sent to the doctor's special research room, its name spoken only in whispers by those at the lab—the Black Cabin. It is said that Rinbell carries out indescribably horrific research within its walls, but the only clue as to what actually happens inside comes from Nizzy herself, who always emerges from its confines covered head to toe in some sort of disgusting mucus.\nLike so many others, the doctor is completely aware of Nizzy's hidden cameras and regards them the same way she does everything else—if it doesn't get in the way of her research, she couldn't care less.\n",

The girl tends to seclude herself in Noctris' room for most of the day, curled up and floating in the air, nestled within the throng of tentacles that protrude from her head. Leaving this room is so taxing that, on the few occasions she does actually leave, she tries incredibly hard to make sure no one sees her.\nUnsurprisingly, this habit of sneaking around has inspired more than a few horror stories in Hexel.\nWhile she may go to great lengths to avoid most people, Nia adores Noctris. Her eyes light up at the mere sight of the woman and the many curiosities she often brings. This is especially true for candy. Nia has an absolutely massive sweet tooth—so massive, in fact, that it's not limited to edible objects. If she finds something interesting, she'll try eating it. The staff in Hexel were even discouraged from using sweet-smelling shampoos until Noctris intervened.\nIf you do have the rare luck to see Nia, you'll probably catch her chatting with Dewey, a pet hamster that Noctris keeps in her room. In fact, the two spend so much time together that they seem to share a genuine mutual understanding. However ludicrous this sounds out of context, it doesn't even crack the top ten of Nia's long list of quirks.\nIt just lends further credence to the theory that, should other worlds truly exist, this girl is strange enough to have come from one.\n",

But he would not let anyone trample on his dreams, and after countless hours spent studying, Millyna was accepted into the imperial military academy.\n\nDespite the malicious admonitions of his family, Millyna did well there—so well, in fact, that he was soon on track to becoming a commanding officer. Yet instead of settling for a lofty, comfortable position, he chose to leave the academy and use his talents to assist the Blacark rebels infesting the empire. It was there that he met Zero, the Blacark's founder.

Unfortunately, the war restricted the distribution of entertainment, making it almost impossible to find fresh anime or manga. She's taken to traveling by herself to obscure, far-off places in search of new fairy tales to enjoy. Unfortunately, she inevitably becomes lost and has to use a shuttle service to return home—eating into her entertainment budget, which in turn swipes from her traveling budget. This vicious cycle more often than not leaves her stuck at home, constantly checking the net for manga she knows she can't afford. While Amber is beyond passionate about a variety of mediums, one type in particular is noticeably absent from her collection: full-text books. Though she claims it's because 3D projections and beautiful illustrations are clearly superior, the truth is Amber often finds the written word a bit hard to wrap her head around without the assistance of visuals. Still, she's intent on sharing the joy she's found in fairy tales, so every Friday she dresses head to toe in her usual pink, hauls a her collection to an orphanage in the city, and reads these stories to the children while acting out the characters in little plays.\nA perplexing amount about Amber is still a mystery, but it's clear to all that she is an honest, pure-hearted individual on a mission to spread happiness throughout the world...even if her methods are a little unusual.

Surrounded by people for the first time in her life, Arial finds herself brimming with curiosity. Now that she has so many kind and compassionate people to observe and learn from, she's finally begun to come out of her shell...figuratively speaking, at least.\nShe tends to learn by imitating what she sees, but that isn't limited to just people—the workshop has a working TV, after all. As a result, many of her newest words have come from watching anime or movies, which might have something to do with her bizarre ideas about human behavior. Still, many in the workshop have come to adore the strange bits of trivia and odd observations she is so eager to share. Her current obsession is the ocean, a topic deep enough to occupy her for nights on end.\nAll of this exposure to new ideas and other people has sparked a sense of self-awareness within Ariel. Though her physical expressions are still rather limited, there is no denying she's a gained a genuine human heart—with all the ups and downs that come with it.

It wasn't hard to find others ready and eager to join her cause, and before long Grave's biggest concern was finding enough mechs and weapons to arm her soldiers. Using her connections and knowledge as a former officer, Grave managed to steal several blueprints for prototype mechs designed by the empire.

With her, the resistance finally had everything it needed to hold its own against of the of most powerful nations on the continent.\nGrave owes her success as a leader not to overwhelming charisma or incredible fighting prowess, but rather to her almost uncanny skill as a tactician. Not a single soul in the empire was considered to be as knowledgeable about military affairs as she was, and those who faced her seldom lived to tell the tale. Grave's refusal to give so much as an inch without making the empire pay dearly for it left both sides on the brink of collapse, but Grave would not relent until the Hexel Union was officially stablished. Only then did she withdraw her forces, finally putting the war to an end.\nDespite her reputation, Grave is a thoughtful and rather quiet individual.

Their debut had to wait for the most recent war's conclusion, but some say they owe their ability to bring strength and comfort to those in need to their firsthand experience on the frontlines. Perhaps it was worth the wait.\nThe older twin, Eggy, focuses on their dance numbers and design work, while the younger twin, Peggy, creates the lyrics and compositions, forming complementary pieces that make perfect use of their respective talents.\nTheir uncanny synchronization extends well beyond their music; both hate green peppers, have slept in the same bed since they were children, and even share all the same clothes and accessories. In fact, they are so in sync that they can often tell what the other is thinking without saying a word.\nStill, even the closest of twins will have their own unique quirks. Eggy is without a doubt the more boisterous of the two, frequently coming up with bold new ideas and pushing for them with feverish intensity. She's also under the belief that frequent close contact will deepen their relationship, which makes her the clingier sister by far. While Peggy is the calmer and more sensible of the two, she still generally indulges Eggy's rambunctious nature by going along with her sister's whims—aside from the ones that will put either their career or themselves at risk, that is. But despite her (frequently loud) protests, Eggy tends to get her way in the end. Eggy will be Eggy, after all.\nPerhaps it's a strange dynamic, but it suits them perfectly. In the end, all they have is each other, and that's more than enough reason to put in the effort needed to make sure it always, always works.",

Given the importance of her role, many are taken aback by her rather diminutive stature—but not for long. Miroa's skill is immediately apparent to anyone who sees her at work, and her ability to calmly and quickly sift through large amounts of data to determine what is important has earned Miroa the respect of all her subordinates.\n\nUnfortunately, all of that goes right out the window the moment someone mentions her height. Miroa is, at heart, a delicate girl who seldom expresses her true feelings, but that is the one topic on which she will make her opinion known. Those with the audacity to tease her about it are met with a withering glare as she prepares to pounce—claws and all. Naturally, there are some who find this reaction charming and provoke her just to see it. These individuals can generally be identified by the large number of scratches and bite marks across their arms and face.\n\nInstead of her definitely perfectly normal height, Miroa would be far happier if people mentioned the hovering device she built herself. She's become so accustomed to floating around that she now prefers it over walking, but the same can't exactly be said for everyone else. There have been a number of raids where someone mistook her for a ghost and triggered a facility-wide lockdown. Still, just mentioning the device is an easy way to get on her good side, which—to be fair—is not hard to do. Just don't ask her how the weather is down there. It's really not that complicated.",
    "2774": "Before Noctris helped her flee to Hexel during Imperial War I, Viorate was a slave in the empire. Her freedom was not without a cost, though—by the time she managed to reach Hexel, an illness had left her on death's door. Viorate had two choices: succumb to the darkness, or attempt a procedure that could either save her life or kill her even more gruesomely. Naturally, Viorate chose the latter.\nThe procedure Viorate proposed was relatively straightforward. Her body, wracked as it was by illness, wouldn't be able to survive much longer, and while they could try to combat the illness directly, there was always the chance of a backlash or remission. As such, the best plan of action would be to fundamentally alter her body, such that the illness could no longer affect it. If the procedure worked, Viorate would emerge not just immune to this disease, but completely unaffected by all pathogens. And if it didn't... Well, she was already dying anyway. Sure enough, Viorate survived. The procedure was a success, leaving her with a body that was not only immune to disease, but also made of pure energy. While it does come with many benefits, this new body is not without its own quirks; namely, that traditional piloting systems tend to overload whenever Viorate is near. When she asked Sumora to build a mech suitable for her new form, Sumora designed an interface that would allow Viorate to directly interface with the mech itself. When they realized this also meant Viorate would act as the mech's power source, the two of them immediately began making further modifications to push the mech's mobility and damage output far beyond what traditional frames—or human pilots, for that matter—could sustain. While this means Viorate must sacrifice her own energy to pilot her mech, it's a sacrifice she makes without question.\nViorate fully credits Noctris for saving her life and has vowed to help the Steel Witch realize her goals. Be it through studying the effects of black meteorite or assisting in potential war efforts, Viorate's keen mind and unique abilities allow her to excel at anything Noctris asks of her. Thanks to her assistance, Noctris has completed a vast amount of research in a shockingly small time. Still, Viorate occasionally reflects on the choice she made that fateful—to struggle, to take risks, and to survive, no matter what she lost in the process. There is no regret in her musings—only renewed determination.\n",

Despite her skill in the cockpit, she hasn't so much as touched a mech since that day—and she'll be the first to tell you she doesn't miss it one bit.\n\nBut make no mistake—Trang didn't become an investigator to make use of some overwhelming talent at solving mysteries. If anything, her skills would have been hopelessly average if not for the immense amount of effort she puts into her work. When Trang is on a case, the details of it take over her life until she becomes a tangled ball of incoherent muttering, following leads and working out the likeliest possibility. And yet for all the groundbreaking cases she has managed to solve, Trang still enjoys the relatively mundane thrill of brain-teasers and mystery novels. By all accounts, she is the perfect case study for how passion and hard work are sometimes all it takes to become exceptional in one's field.\n\nTrang is a frequent patron of ComiBoni, the bar Kristina runs as part of her own investigative work. Apparently, Trang really wanted to work as Kristina's assistant and solve cases together, but Kristina simply laughed at the idea. Why would she ever need help?

Even as a child, she would spend all her time listening in on the conversations of adults. But the more she learned, the more she realized how truly complex the world was—far more so than any one person could ever understand. Rather than get discouraged, she was filled with a burning curiosity and bursting with questions. She would learn, grow, and find her place in the world, and she would get there by learning everything she could. \nHer curiosity persisted well into her military career, where her astute nature and hunger for knowledge quickly made her a hot topic among peers and superiors alike. What's more, her ability to genuinely listen to what the other person is saying and learn from them has resolved more than a few debates. Unfortunately, it would be impossible to actually apply everything she's learned over the years to her current career—but that's where her hobby comes in. Vivine is a budding fantasy novelist, and loves nothing more than to spend her free time exploring worlds and lives beyond her own through the tip of her pen.\nWhile Vivine is an apt listener, her writing—and the obsession with finding just the right combination of words that comes with it—has led to her reading a little too much into how people phrase their thoughts, especially when it involves topics she's interested in. Which, to be fair, is most of them. If there is such thing as a perfect sentence, though, she's sure to be the first to put it to paper.",

She quickly learned the nature of her world—a place where the strong stole from the weak and the weak stole from the weaker. It was ten years of endless struggle before she could begin to climb up the food chain herself. The only constant over those ten years were the bad seeds she found dealing with time and time again—\"gentlemen,\" as they'd tricked the world into calling them.\nEvery gentleman Alexa encountered had the same slippery way about them—a coldness in their smile that matched the deceitful glints of their eyes. But rather than cry out in frustration, Alexa found it enjoyable. To her, navigating the web of lies and half-truths was fun—almost as if it were just a game to her. And in some ways, perhaps it was. Her constant exposure to such tactics only honed her natural cunning. At the young age of fourteen she established her own group of slum dwellers—the self-titled Shapeshifters—and used every trick in the book to quickly cement her posse as a powerhouse on par with groups like Judgment Star and Sweet Queen.\nNowadays, Alexa's group plays nice with the modern Hexel Union...though not because she feels particularly cowed by them—she simply prefers to keep their relationship civil when possible. Alexa usually acts independently, happily playing the part of a gentleman in her handsome hat and suit like so many as many of the crooks she learned from and even admired as a child. Her perfectly polished mannerisms and modest smile are fundamental parts of what make her own finely crafted games of deception so thrilling. While no one can ever tell what she's truly planning, one thing is always certain: she's having a hell of a good time.\n",

That's not to say she doesn't use the traditional assortment of magician's tools, but for Breeze a large part of the thrill comes in connecting with her audience on a personal level.\nShe doesn't want to stop at merely entertaining her patrons—she wants to capture their hearts, to give them spectacular memories they can cherish for the rest of their lives. To that end, she journeys across the continent to hone her repertoire and explore new techniques. There's nothing she won't do to become the world's most accomplished magician.\nWhile her dedication to the craft is impressive, her greatest strength is perhaps the ability to listen to others and understand their problems.

Oddly, it was not Fulla's formidable talents that formed this bond, but her evil, blackened heart—a darkness that rivals even Alexa's. Together, the two play a dangerous game. Alexa lays the trap and lures their prey with honeyed words and veiled threats. Their target's resolve thus weakens, and Fulla dives in for the mostly figurative kill. So complete is their attack that most \"victims\" simply roll over and accept defeat. After all, they've already been beaten. Why resist and make things worse?\nFulla is a quick learner. With each \"negotiation,\" her ridicule becomes more pointed, more cruel, more dangerously close to the devil itself—more like Alexa's.

Her list of collected bounties is so long, you have to wonder if she even sleeps.\nBut despite her reputation, Leigh wasn't always like this—at least, not until her father died. Ever since that day, she has worked herself to the bone to obtain information on her enemies. The mountain of bounties she's turned in might inspire awe in others, but to Leigh they're just a heap of hard-fought dead ends. Perhaps most remarkable is how far she's come without any superhuman ability outside of her sheer force of will. Even pushed to the brink of death, Leigh claws back time and time again with nothing but hard work. Who needs strength when you simply refuse to die?\nFitting with her image as a work-obsessed lunatic, Leigh has almost no friends. Kristina, the owner of the ComiBoni bar, is the exception that proves the rule—though the abundance of high-quality wine she supplies Leigh might have something to do with their friendship. Very few people know wine is Leigh's sole interest outside of work, a burning passion she pairs with an even deeper knowledge—she can almost always discern a drink by scent alone. Of course, it certainly doesn't hurt that Kristina's bar is a great place to gather information on her bounties...\n",

While skilled in combat, her true strength lies in creating mechs, though this only makes it all the more painful when she sees her creations used to slaughter soldiers and civilians alike. \n\nSumora firmly believes in looking at the bright side of a situation, a philosophy she maintained even in the darkest times. She used the war to hone her already impressive piloting skills, making the very threat of her deployment something of a deterrent to would-be trouble-makers. Even the loss of her arm evoked not despair, but determination—she merely replaced it with an augmented shoulder and a mechanical replica. The way she saw it, hand injuries were all but certain in her line of work, and now she didn't have to worry about them. Better yet, just think of the augmentations she could do...\n\nAs the leader of the Designer's Family, Sumora is responsible for a considerable number of the products created within Hexel, and her talent for coming up with new designs is surpassed by only the Steel Witch herself.

Now, Hepneyg's name is spoken across the continent through sneers and disgust.

She knew from an early age that getting out of the empire's slums would take smarts, talent, and a considerable amount of money. Yet her talent for thievery meant nothing when it was directed at ordinary people. Even a whole day of searching for marks would often yield little more than what was needed to make it to sunrise.\nBut Thea's confidence in her skills continued to grow, and soon she set her sights a little higher than pilfering pocket change: she would rob the nobility. The fact that getting caught would mean a quick death didn't bother her in the least. After all, she firmly believed that anyone born into wealth was too stupid to be able to protect it—much less deserve it. If anything, it was for their own good. They would be easy marks. And yet, her first attempt went wrong—very, very wrong. She readied herself for the punishment she had never taken seriously, but the lord who caught her was a strange one. Rather than kill her, he fashioned a set of unbreakable handcuffs and released her back into the wild of the slums—now marked forever as a would-be-thief who dared raise a hand against the nobles. With no way to remove them, she would spend the rest of her life free but bound, a prisoner for all the world to scorn.\nThea regrets her actions—the getting caught part, at least—but she has never been one to wallow in self-pity.

The shackles that had bound their frail human bodies ripped away like paper, leaving the inmates free to overrun their captors and rampage towards the outside world. Fearing what carnage the frenzied undead would wreak upon his domain, the ruling lord of the region ordered his army to turn the prison into an inescapable tomb of wreckage. And so, trapped with the other prisoners, Shmily lay beneath the rubble for what felt like somewhere between years and millennia, until time lost all meaning.\nHer waiting would eventually pay off, but the damage had already been done—a lifetime spent in complete isolation had twisted her into a being of pure apathy.

And so, a plan to modify the host installation was set in motion.\nAlthough they merely wanted to escape from the Digital Realm, the methods used by the inhabitants were detrimental to Evelynn's wellbeing. And yet, despite possessing enough of the Creator's authority to simply remove anyone who sought to harm her, Evelynn refused to abuse her power. Fortunately, her childhood friend Coral stood by her through all this—even if the others branded her a traitor for her kindness and loyalty. Worried for Coral's safety, Evelynn decided the two of them has to escape.\nBut another Evelynn remained, and though she was little more than an echo of the original—a malignant pathogen whose existence is seemingly at odds with the world she resides in—she was still at one point an individual manifestation of consciousness stemming from the same body. While their shared origin means the pathogen possesses some of Evelynn's habits, her personality is vastly different.\n",
    "2796": "After the catastrophe in the Digital Realm, the digitized Evelynn regained her body and managed to carry Coral's digital consciousness back to the real world with her. Coral now projects a virtual facsimile of herself through the bracelet Evelynn wears on her wrist, making the two of them inseparable in every sense of the word. \nGiven everything they've been through, this could be considered a happy ending—in truth, Evelynn is more determined than ever to find a way to get Coral back to her original body. But as Evelynn has already returned to hers, she can no longer interfere with the Digital Realm, or at least not directly. Instead, she can only interface with her old domain by operating an external machine—the super computer itself.\nAfter hearing about Evelynn's plan, Coral began researching the civilizations that existed before the calamity in the hope that some of the information might help her dear friend. In the meantime, the two of them dream about the day they can embrace each other in their true physical forms.\n",
    "2797": "One can hardly mention Hexel without evoking the image of Solar the War Maniac. Her destructive tendencies and habit of utterly devastating any place unfortunate enough to serve as her battleground have earned her the title of Calamity Witch—a title she adores, given her intense love for war and chaos. For Solar, the only thing better than fighting against a powerful faction is fighting against multiple overwhelming forces. This is no mere hubris—her unprecedented talent and reflexes have turned the tide in her favor countless times, and those who underestimate her do so at their own peril.\nDespite boasting a near-undefeated record against even the most veteran of challengers, there is one person she has never been able to best—Noctris, the Steel Witch. In the five years Solar has known Noctris, she has challenged her 542 times, and been defeated every single one.\nAlthough Solar is a menace on the battlefield, she struggles whenever a problem requires more than raw, unrelenting violence. Noctris is not only aware of this, but exploits it whenever the two clash. Of their many matches, all but a handful were situations only winnable through brainpower. The few that were true physical contests—usually because Solar challenged Noctris while the latter was in a particularly foul mood—resulted in defeats that were even more humiliating than usual.\nIf you feel like you can't beat Solar's forces, try getting her to agree to one-on-one combat. Sources say two people have successfully defeated her army this way, though the other 48 who attempted the same thing were executed for their trickery. Still, 2/50 is technically better odds than the one-sided slaughter that usually follows in her wake. Oh, and Solar is quite proud of her sharp teeth and dark skin, so if you have any negative comments about them—not that you should, of course—just keep those to yourself. You'll live a much longer life for it.\n",
    "2798": "You first met 22 and 33 after discovering an old, but well-preserved laboratory in the ruins of a neutral area. Your unwitting invasion triggered 33's alarms, which awakened her sister, 22.\nThe two of them possess an incredible knowledge of ancient technology. When it comes to the modern world, however, they could hardly be more clueless. In order to help get them accustomed to modern society, it was decided they would take over the laboratory and use it to conduct research. They were quite keen on the idea, and almost immediately began calling the lab their \"base of operations\" and discussing plans for renovation.\nAlthough they share many similarities, they are not actually twins and have many unique quirks—some stranger than others. 22, for example, is a sunny girl who immediately leaps at every chance she gets to help others. Unfortunately, her clumsiness often ends up causing even more problems, which she subsequently attempts to solve, causing even MORE problems, and so on. This vicious cycle extends to her relationship with 33. As the older sister, 22 tends to be a bit overprotective. Yet it is often 33 who has to help clean up the disasters her sister leaves in her wake.\n33, meanwhile, is quiet and withdrawn, rarely expressing herself beyond the bare minimum required to get to the end of a conversation. While she may lack social skills, she's a talented programmer with an enormous amount of experience. Sure, she teases 22 for her clumsiness and even pranks her on occasion, but 33's love for her sister is clear as daylight.\nWhat's less clear is why 33 can't seem to stop putting power sockets and batteries in her mouth. The most popular theory is she somehow thinks they can amp up her programming skills, but the truth is anybody's guess.",

    "6879": "What? You're bored? Hold on just a moment, then. I need to finish these repairs.",
    "6880": "Thank you, Captain. You've made me see the beauty of probability.",
    "6881": "There are days when I'm content to just relax.",
    "6882": "Happy birthday, Captain. May you grow even more wise in the coming year.",
    "6883": "Hey! Your timing's perfect. How 'bout you and me go into business together?",
    "6884": "The hell's up with you? I haven't got any candy, y'know.",
    "6885": "I know—rare for brains like mine to come packed in brawn this fine, but miracles do happen!",
    "6886": "Hahahaha! You're a total riot!",
    "6887": "What? I didn't swipe nothin' from your desk.",
    "6888": "Captain, your watch looks real nice. Would be a real shame if someone stole it, huh?",
    "6889": "What d'you think? My equipment's pretty badass, right?",
    "6890": "You got that look in you're eye that says you're about to start somethin'.",
    "6891": "The doors here are too damn small! My mechanical arms got stuck last time I took an elevator.",
    "6892": "You know, I'd actually hesitate if I had to choose between gold and you.",
    "6893": "Wha...? What'd you say? Oh! How much is that ring you got?",
    "6894": "Gimme a shout if you're bored and wanna come with.",
    "6895": "Happy birthday, Leader! I found you the perfect gift. Now all we gotta do is steal it.",
    "6896": "Good day. Are you the leader of this mercenary team? Well, then! Your reputation precedes you.",
    "6897": "I would like you to keep quiet if there's nothing that requires my attention.",
    "6898": "Oh, I see. Now this is who you really are.",
    "6899": "Your manners lack a certain degree of... class.",
    "6900": "Why not consider acting as a gentleman would?",
    "6901": " I sincerely request the honor of your company for afternoon tea.",
    "6902": "Excuse me, but I'm reading. Would you simmer down?",
    "6903": "Phew! I never expected pruning the garden to be so tiring!",
    "6904": "You need to learn some manners.",
    "6905": "You needn't make a fuss over me. A lady must always be able to protect herself.",
    "6906": "Today shall be a wonderful day to remember.",
    "6907": "A gentleman shouldn't leave a lady to be bored by her lonesome.",
    "6908": "Happy birthday, Captain! A lot has happened this year, hasn't it?",
    "6909": "Heya! I'm Mary, part of the Aritan Defense Force. Are you busy? If not, let's chat!",
    "6910": "This bracelet was super expensive, so don't fiddle with it.",
    "6911": "Okay! For this month's spending, I have... Wow. Cutting it close.",
    "6912": "Do you know any decent gigs around here? Something that pays real good.",
    "6913": "Think I could take tomorrow off, Captain?",
    "6914": "What do you think? Do you like my necklace?",
    "6915": "Come on! You gotta know how good it feels to blow your salary all in one go!",
    "6916": "Aww... I'm low on cash. When's payday again?",
    "6917": "I wanna show you something, Captain, but you're gonna have to cough up the cash to see it.",
    "6918": "Tell me what you think of this dress I'm wearing. What? Too expensive?",
    "6919": "A guy like you's worth way more than your wallet to me.",
    "6920": "Lemme think... So we'll hit up the bakery next to the station first, and then... then...",
    "6921": "Happy birthday! I totally splurged for your special day. Hope you like it!",
    "6922": "Ah... Umm... P-Please to mee—ow! My head! Oh, what bopped me this time?",
    "6923": "Captain... may I help you?",
    "6924": "Well, I often go long-distance running, so I'm confident in my physical strength.",
    "6925": "Excuse me, but have you seen my kneepads? I put them right here...",
    "6926": "Wh-Why is my room the only one that sprung a leak?",
    "6927": "W-Wait! I just got back from a run. I might stink a bit...",
    "6928": "I hope it doesn't rain during tomorrow's mission.",
    "6929": "Hey, which do you think looks better on me? Black or blue?",
    "6930": "My mech doesn't spontaneously combust anymore, and it's all thanks to our mechanic.",
    "6931": "I-I know my luck is just⁠—just t-terrible, but surely, you can forgive me...",
    "6932": "I'll r-remember this day forever! By the way, it might be a good idea to lock this in a safe. Then again, my last safe exploded...",
    "6933": "If there's nothing else for the moment, Captain, could I go out for a run?",
    "6934": "Happy birthday, Captain... I-I didn't get you anything. I didn't...uh...know what you wanted.",
    "6935": "Hey. You the captain around here? You look all right enough to me.",
    "6936": "Keep pushin', all right? Our lives are in your hands.",
    "6937": "Man up and quit draggin' your feet!",
    "6938": "Don't hesitate for a moment once you've made a decision.",
    "6939": "Whatever you do, you've got a better chance of success if you try.",
    "6940": "Which do you prefer: high risk and high return, or low risk and low return?",
    "6941": "I want to be on the front lines forever.",
    "6942": "You've become much more handsome lately. Not as much as my boss, but still.",
    "6943": "It's good to exercise here and there. Trust me: your body'll thank you later.",
    "6944": "Hey, Captain? Wanna go for a ride on the back of my motorcycle?",
    "6945": "What...? Are you insane? How could you say that, you dumbass!",
    "6946": "Hey! Laziness isn't gonna cut it around here. Get up!",
    "6947": "Happy birthday, Captain. Get ready, 'cause this coming year's gonna be a lot of fun.",
    "6948": "Why call me here? Aren't you afraid that I'll slice your throat?",
    "6949": "I suggest you don't touch these hands.",
    "6950": "Are you troubled? Then allow me to set you free.",
    "6951": "It appears you hold no love for this world.",
    "6952": "Don't touch me. I still haven't forgiven you.",
    "6953": "Y-You don't think you can get away with anything just because I haven't done anything about it yet, do you?",
    "6954": "You... You fiend!",
    "6955": "Take one more step, and I'll sock you!",
    "6956": "Wh-What do you think you're doing?!",
    "6957": "Perhaps I shouldn't blame you for the decisions our father made...",
    "6958": "You don't mind? I... I know it's wrong, but I can't suppress these feelings. Is it really, truly all right?",
    "6959": "Don't get the wrong idea, but I sometimes think you're not so bad... Again, that means absolutely nothing.",
    "6960": "So...h-happy birthday, then. That's it. ...Ah! Don't try to hug me! Go away!",
    "6961": "Wasn't expecting to see you again like this... Huh? What? Don't you recognize me?",
    "6962": "I bet the head of a captain is worth some serious dough.",
    "6963": "You know, there are a LOT of bounty hunters who'd love to bring you in.",
    "6964": "Try not to interrupt my studies too much, Captain.",
    "6965": "If only I could've caught you then...",
    "6966": "What sports are you into, Captain?",
    "6967": "I found a nice spot to play badminton earlier. Turned out perfect!",
    "6968": "Has little Pincushion eaten well? Ah⁠—that's my hedgehog's name. Isn't it cute?",
    "6969": "I always hope for a peaceful resolution.",
    "6970": "If you need any help, just call me. I'll be waiting right here.",
    "6971": "I wish for all my friends to be happy someday, Captain. Can you make my wish come true?",
    "6972": "Are you tired? I'm sure a cup of tea'll perk you right up.",
    "6973": "Happy birthday, Captain. Would you like to try this cake I made all by myself?",
    "6974": "Are you the captain? I'll skip the pleasantries, then. I will not interfere with your work—just like you won't interfere with mine.",
    "6975": "What is it? If it's nothing, then I'll be going.",
    "6976": "We northerners tend to be on the taller side.",
    "6977": "I miss living surrounded by snow.",
    "6978": "Shush. I'm trying to concentrate. Do not disturb me.",
    "6979": "How about we share a drink, Captain? This liquor I have is a specialty of the north's. I promise you won't regret it.",
    "6980": "Do you play chess, Captain? ...5D chess? What is that?",
    "6981": "I'm telling you, Captain, that Aita is...",
    "6982": "I used to think growing up under elite education was difficult, but when I look back, it wasn't that bad.",
    "6983": "I owe who I am now to my father. I'm so grateful to him.",
    "6984": "What do you mean, you want to be my friend? Have we not been friends all this time?",
    "6985": "Get up, Captain. There's no time to rest.",
    "6986": "Happy birthday, Captain. Shall we have a drink to celebrate?",
    "6987": "Umm... You can come to me for intel. But don't ask me anything weird. That's it.",
    "6988": "There's no point, so knock it off.",
    "6989": "You men are always curious about this kinda stuff.",
    "6990": "High-energy laser locked in. Take one step and I'll shoot.",
    "6991": "I need neither comfort nor encouragement.",
    "6992": "Go to town, I guess. Just don't let this get in the way of my work.",
    "6993": "I only have to satisfy your curiosity, right, Captain?",
    "6994": "People are looking, Captain.",
    "6995": "I'm not sure what it is about men that makes me feel better whenever they give me a pat on the head.",
    "6996": "You've made this place comfortable, Captain. I think I'll stay a bit longer.",
    "6997": "I'm no good at sweet talk, but... thank you for helping me realize I'm not alone.",
    "6998": "What intel are you in the market for? I'll tell you everything I know.",
    "6999": "Happy birthday, Captain. Good for you to celebrate your special day.",
    "7000": "Hello! You don't mind if I bring my cats on board, do you? They're all very clever and well behaved.",
    "7001": "Your stroking is about as smooth as a cat's tongue.",
    "7002": "Kittens won't go anywhere near you if you play rough.",
    "7003": "Learning to care for these cuties is a lesson in itself.",
    "7004": "You're tall for someone so young, Captain.",
    "7005": "Mereda is a good place, Captain. I'll take you there sometime so you can see for yourself.",
    "7006": "If the cats think you're an all right guy, then I think you're all right guy.",
    "7007": "Meooow! ...I've always wanted to try doing that, but I guess it's not the same as the real thing, huh?",
    "7008": "I've noticed the cats have been warming up to you, Captain.",
    "7009": "You just need to treat me like I treat cats.",
    "7010": "Once I retire, I want to return to the countryside and spend my days in leisure with the cats... and you.",
    "7011": "If we've got some downtime, then do you mind if I play with the cats?",
    "7012": "Happy birthday, Captain. And what a pretty day it is to celebrate!",
    "7013": "Adrienne, reporting for duty. I am happy to complete any assignment to the best of my abilities.",
    "7014": "I hope you can abide by the rules, Captain.",
    "7015": "Please exercise some self-discipline, Captain.",
    "7016": "Captain, laziness is not a virtue.",
    "7017": "I suggest you start reading up on the army's rules and regulations.",
    "7018": "Don't act like that. Lazy is lazy.",
    "7019": "I know you've been busy lately, but I wanted to... Forget it.",
    "7020": "I do make an effort to not always be so hard on others.",
    "7021": "What I do in my spare time? Listen to folk music, usually.",
    "7022": "If you're free, Captain, would you like to spar with me?",
    "7023": "Self-discipline is a must if you want to achieve greatness. Don't you agree?",
    "7024": "You aren't sleeping on the job, are you? ...Of course I'd notice.",
    "7025": "Are you the captain of this unit? Do you mind if I start work right away?",
    "7026": "Despite my family background, I actually prefer legal work.",
    "7027": "Did you know that the empire's form of government existed before its official formation sixty years ago?",
    "7028": "I enjoy studying history from before the Sundering. I just wish records from then weren't so hard to come by.",
    "7029": "Hexel is home to many former Keghan slaves. They and their descendants naturally carry an unshakable hatred for the empire.",
    "7030": "Many thought Arita turned away the slaves escaping from Kegha, but that's not the case.",
    "7031": "There's something fascinating about ancient civilizations. I'm sure their influence remains with us today. There might even be ancient people walking among us.",
    "7032": "Hexel was rife with civil war until the Steel Witch conquered the land.",
    "7033": "Perhaps Noctris isn't as miraculous as you expected her to be, but it's difficult to comprehend just many leagues she is ahead of the rest of us.",
    "7034": "From this day on, I will no longer sit idle as history's scholar; I will be its witness.",
    "7035": "Are you as interested in my personal history as I am about the world's?",
    "7036": "I'm sure I can uncover more of history's long-forgotten mysteries by being here.",
    "7037": "Happy birthday! So is this how it feels to celebrate others' special days?",
    "7038": "Call it reporter's intuition, but I just know I'll be able to find out all kinds of interesting stuff with you!",
    "7039": "I can hear some news calling my name! Sorry, Captain! Gotta run!",
    "7040": "Oh! Oh-oh-oh! I saw you reach out your hand toward Evelynn! I snapped a pic!",
    "7041": "I've found where the hottest gossip in this region is!",
    "7042": "C'mon... C'mon! Where're all those major scoops hiding?",
    "7043": "Do you think you could leave me alone, Captain? I can't take any pictures with you all over me.",
    "7044": "Relations across the continent are tense these days. Not a good sign, I tell you!",
    "7045": "Hmm? You want to see everything I've been recording?",
    "7046": "Captain, I think we should mod my camera.",
    "7047": "Hey, hey, hey! This document here? It's full of stuff from my secret collection. Wanna see?",
    "7048": "I'll be putting the rest of your life in this itty-bitty camera. Are you up for that?",
    "7049": "Captain? Did you leave me all alone to go do something fun?",
    "7050": "I'd never miss a scoop like our captain's birthday! And here's my gift to you: a special viewing of my entire secret collection, totally free of charge!",
    "7051": "A pleasure, Captain. I'm Michaelia, Hexel's foremost expert in EMP weapons.",
    "7052": "Can't say I'm a fan of bitter stuff⁠. Coffee especially.",
    "7053": "I can't eat or drink anything hot. It burns my mouth.",
    "7054": "I find all things relating to electromagnetism fascinating.",
    "7055": "I wonder where Tris got all her knowledge from...",
    "7056": "Don't you think little Nia is just adorable?",
    "7057": "Did you know that I've been interested in my field since I was four years old?",
    "7058": "Hexel is filled with this sense of freedom. Nowhere else in the world could even begin to compare.",
    "7059": "I'm sure electromagnetic weapons will become commonplace in the future.",
    "7060": "If possible, I'd like to study Nova's physical makeup.",
    "7061": "Uh... You want to be friends? I mean, sure. No reason to say no.",
    "7062": "Is this supposed to happen? ...Huh? That doesn't seem right...",
    "7063": "Happy birthday, Captain. We'll have to keep at it together, won't we?",
    "7064": "How's it going, Captain? Mind if I scooch over somewhere a tad warmer?",
    "7065": "Captain, let's move to the South once winter arrives, okay?",
    "7066": "What was that? I'm not wearing insoles! I really am this tall—swear!",
    "7067": "Arrrgh... Cold weather is just the WORST.",
    "7068": "You gotta practice skating at least three hours a day.",
    "7069": "So, you don't need me to explain why this scarf is great, right?",
    "7070": "I'm in the market for some new grav-skates, Captain, and I want you to come along!",
    "7071": "Captain, do you know any good ways to grow faster?",
    "7072": "Blech. I drink milk every single day, but I'm not seeing much of a difference...",
    "7073": "Oh, snap! You bought a heater for me?! You're the best, Captain!",
    "7074": "Once we retire, let's live out the rest of our days somewhere comfy and warm!",
    "7075": "Did you nod off, Captain?",
    "7076": "Happy birthday, Captain. Why don't I show off a few grav-skating moves for you as a present?",
    "7077": "What can I do for you? Wait a sec. You don't know my network ID, do you?",
    "7078": "A programmer's hands are worth their weight in gold, you know.",
    "7079": "Uh, what's with the squatting?",
    "7080": "How much can I claim from you in damages for you to owe me for the rest of your life.",
    "7081": "Don't touch my hair.",
    "7082": "Touching'll cost you, but since you're special, I'll give you a discount.",
    "7083": "So... what are you going to do down there?",
    "7084": "I'll have you know that you're responsible for your touching.",
    "7085": "The pigtail is cute, right?",
    "7086": "Every touch is an extra year you have to spend with me. Got it?",
    "7087": "Seriously? You're willing to take care of me forever? Heehee... I'd love that. Now and long into the future.",
    "7088": "I'm happy with my life now. I don't worry about my legs the way I used to.",
    "7089": "I made a webpage dedicated to your shenanigans for your birthday, Captain. What, feeling a bit nervous?",
    "7090": "Though our partnership is temporary, I pray it will be a pleasant one.",
    "7091": "Behave yourself!",
    "7092": "Men may know each other through curiosity and yearing, but where they would lead themselves to, is a mystery.",
    "7093": "I have no doubt that humans are inherently evil.",
    "7094": "Those stuck in the past can never progress to the future.",
    "7095": "There's something in your eyes right now that I'm not quite comprehending.",
    "7096": "You're similar to my savior in some ways.",
    "7097": "Only fear can reveal a person's true nature.",
    "7098": "Have you ever tried to understand people with turmoil stirring their hearts?",
    "7099": "To have too many emotions is a curse. One that will bring misfortune to you and those around you.",
    "7100": "When one reaches deep within a person's soul, they often come to lose something of themselves in the process.",
    "7101": "Looks like we have free time. Come, Alte.",
    "7102": "I don't have a gift for you, so you'll have to accept my heartfelt wishes instead. Happy birthday.",
    "7103": "I am Commander Coreleah of the Aritan Defense Force. I hope you're one to keep reckless behavior in check.",
    "7104": "I suspect your unit is rather undisciplined, Captain.",
    "7105": "I do believe it's time we corrected your concept of discipline.",
    "7106": "Your eyes are too close to the screen. You'll go blind if you keep that up.",
    "7107": "Is there something on my face?",
    "7108": "Why, yes—I am indeed versed in needlework. Do you need something tailored?",
    "7109": "Hard work is admirable, yes, but not if you wear yourself out in the process.",
    "7110": "A rag doll? ...How did you know I like these?",
    "7111": "I wonder how Queen Lilian is faring... Pardon. Forget I said anything.",
    "7112": "Even if I chose to leave it behind, I can't help missing my life as a knight. Have you ever felt that way about anything?",
    "7113": "It's strange, having such a dear friend like you… but it's certainly not a bad feeling.",
    "7114": "Call me if you require my aid. I shall be here.",
    "7115": "Happy birthday, Captain. I have a gift for you.",
    "7116": "Whoa. Haven't seen you for a long time now. Look how much you've grown!",
    "7117": "Hmm? What can I do for you? Name it, and I'm on it.",
    "7118": "Hahaha! You haven't changed.",
    "7119": "I mean, I don't personally care, but you might want to show more respect to those older than you.",
    "7120": "Wanna check out my antique collection?",
    "7121": "Aren't clingy guys unpopular with the ladies?",
    "7122": "Wanna see how to fire a gun?",
    "7123": "I met up with Aita, and y'know what? It's like it was just yesterday with her! Still the same dolt I remember.",
    "7124": "I'd be down to try on an imperial knight's uniform.",
    "7125": "You don't seem that busy. How about we take a whack at some black market dealings?",
    "7126": "Hahaha! You're a funny guy. ...Wait. What? This isn't some joke?",
    "7127": "You tryin' to have some fun without me?",
    "7128": "Happy birthday! Keep striving to make it big so you can take on the whole world!",
    "7129": "You're late. This is not befitting of a captain's status. Pay more attention in the future.",
    "7130": "How many times must I tell you not to whisper during meetings?",
    "7131": "Your performance in your missions could stand some improvement.",
    "7132": "In theory, so long as any process is managed with competence, progress will make itself known.",
    "7133": "Exercising your freedoms is all well and good, but take care not to overindulge.",
    "7134": "Those who are sloppy are incapable of setting a fine example.",
    "7135": "Don't dawdle. An efficient life is a better life.",
    "7136": "Trust is the most necessary thing to have in any relationship. Understand?",
    "7137": "Stand tall against an inferior opponent and they'll cower before you every time.",
    "7138": "Slowing down simply isn't in me. I believe in putting my all into everything I do.",
    "7139": "Is this all romance is? What a hollow concept. A farce. And yet also... meaningful.",
    "7140": "You sure you have time to waste? Go on! Back to work.",
    "7141": "Happy Birthday, Captain. Promptly return to work once the festivities are over.",
    "7142": "I am a ronin from a distant land who has grown weary from her journey. I would take my due rest here before setting off again.",
    "7143": "There is still much in the world I don't know or have yet to experience.",
    "7144": "Your desire to revive the ideals of your predecessor is admirable.",
    "7145": "Do you believe in the concept of \"every man for himself\"?",
    "7146": "The Empire's Choice? Hmm... The event brings back memories.",
    "7147": "The Eastern Ziolan people hunt in the same manner their ancestors did. It's quite a rare custom to practice.",
    "7148": "The knight's code of chivalry is not unlike our bushido code of conduct.",
    "7149": "Arita's people are so lively. It's so different from where I'm from.",
    "7150": "I'm not fond of how restrictive the nation of Thia is on its people.",
    "7151": "I need more exercise. Not just physical—mental exercise is equally important.",
    "7152": "I started my journey to find myself, but perhaps there was a part of me that hoped someone would find me along the way.",
    "7153": "Rest if you're tired. Nothing good will come from forcing yourself.",
    "7154": "Happy birthday, Captain. I'll remember this day well.",
    "7155": "Hello. My name is Roxanne. I pray you'll come to me should any trouble befall you.",

    "7220": "We're adults now, Captain. Why the heck d'you wanna hold hands?",
    "7221": "You'd pull this same stunt when we were kids, too. You haven't grown up a bit.",
    "7222": "Wanna feel 'em? Heh! Keep dreaming.",
    "7223": "I'm so stumped by this feeling...",

    "7248": "Must I be forced to correct your behavior down to the very basics?",
    "7249": "Captain, have you always been so undisciplined?",
    "7250": "You must learn to hone your focus, Captain.",
    "7251": "I ask that you only focus on what's necessary while working.",

    "7259": "Ah... Sorry. You weren't hurt, were you?",
    "7260": "Hmm?",
    "7261": "Sorry... My body just does what it wants sometimes. Need me to help you up?",
    "7262": "I don't... like that.",
    "7263": "Is this some kind of new order?",
    "7264": "Your interests are... very weird.",
    "7265": "I'll be sure not to cut the main artery.",

    "7276": "What are you doing?",
    "7277": "I'd rather be squatting in some corner. Can I go back now?",
    "7278": "I could curse you by drawing just one circle.",
    "7279": "You're in for some real hell.",
    "7280": "You're a strange person...",
    "7281": "No matter how hard you try, some things simply won't change. Still...I won't deny your efforts any longer.",
    "7282": "...",
    "7283": "So...today is your birthday?",
    "7284": "Hello. So you're the last heir of him? How interesting.",
    "7285": "What sort of music do you like? I wish to play something for you.",
    "7286": "The piano is a most wonderful instrument, yes?",
    "7287": "Well well, aren't you a curious person?",
    "7288": "You could say that fiddling with these piano wires has become... a hobby of mine.",
    "7289": "Have you come to listen to my tales of travel?",
    "7290": "My fans are quite enthusiastic⁠—perhaps a bit too much so.",
    "7291": "You would like to know what life is like outside the continent?",
    "7292": "Heehee... I see traces of 'him' when I gaze upon you.",
    "7293": "I composed a special piece for this trip.",
    "7294": "I have performed countless times all over the world and seen many interesting characters... but you are the most interesting one by far.",
    "7295": "There are times when one needs to be left in peace.",
    "7296": "Happy birthday, Captain. Would you like to hear a private performance? It is a rare opportunity worth entertaining.",
    "7297": "Nice to meet you, but as a heads up, I'm out as soon as this places loses its spark. Nothing personal—just gotta follow the fun.",
    "7298": "Your conduct is not at all amusing.",
    "7299": "Are you trying to get a reaction from me?",
    "7300": "Don't lump me in with those amateurs.",
    "7301": "How about you do some damage in your vehicle?",
    "7302": "Make sure you grab a me glass of water to go with my meals. Think you can do that for me?",
    "7303": "Hmm? You wanna see how much I kick ass? Bring it on, then.",
    "7304": "Up for playing a fighting game? If you are, I won't show any mercy.",
    "7305": "I only fight the strong. Nothing less will do.",
    "7306": "My dream? To reach the top of the world. That's it.",
    "7307": "I've got a feeling life'll be fun with you. May as well stay and find out.",
    "7308": "I'm bored. Is there anything cool to do?",
    "7309": "Didn't realize right away it was your birthday, Captain. Today's full of surprises.",

    "7322": "Your bad behavior is SO going on camera... Ack! Wait a sec! My camera!",
    "7323": "See my streaming equipment? It was modded by a total god of a specialist.",
    "7324": "Okay, so! Leader asked some people to help boost my subscribers, right? Do you think it's some weird, roundabout way of showing she cares?",
    "7325": "I couldn't stream live on the battlefield without her... It means a lot to me.",
    "7326": "My type? Well, They've gotta be strong so they can protect me. Oh! And that kinda far-off look in their eye, you know? And... Ahhh! Don't get any ideas!",
    "7327": "Everyone in our crew is so friendly! I love hanging out here.",
    "7328": "WH-WH-WHAAA—?! No way! Idols can't go on dates! Besides, I've already got a...a crush on someone...",

    "7332": "Umm... Hello.",
    "7333": "Is... something the matter?",
    "7334": "Oh. A bug.",
    "7335": "Careful. I was expensive to develop.",
    "7336": "I dislike routine maintenance.",
    "7337": "Do you have new orders?",
    "7338": "I hope the coordinates are clear enough...",
    "7339": "I'd prefer if you didn't tap my container.",
    "7340": "May I take a nap if there's nothing to do?",
    "7341": "Abnormal heartrate and pulse, change in facial expression and body temperature detected. You are ill.",
    "7342": "Standby mode.",
    "7343": "Happy birthday, Captain. My data tells me this is cause for celebration, but I'm...not sure how to go about doing that.",
    "7344": "Hello, hello! I'm the Orchestral Witch⁠—I got the name like the others. Teehee! Do you think it fits?",
    "7345": "My! Your uniform's gotten dirty. Best take that off and throw it right in the wash.",
    "7346": "Would you like to try this dessert I whipped up?",
    "7347": "My little witches are too adorable for words. I love them with all my heart.",

    "7352": "Little Noctris hasn't slept in several days. Oh, I do worry about that girl's health...",
    "7353": "Hmm? Do you need a hug? Then that's exactly what you'll get.",
    "7354": "This makes me truly happy, but still... I've my little darlings to consider.",
    "7355": "Oh? You won't need my help, will you?",
    "7356": "Happy birthday, Captain. Now, close your eyes... Mama's got a little surprise for you.",
    "7357": "How'd you like to take part in some experiments? Paid time and three square meals a day. Well?",
    "7358": "Ahh... Mollusks are amazing little creatures.",
    "7359": "Maybe I should adjust the concentration of this acidic solution.",
    "7360": "Is Subject 97 not going to make it? I'm sure I didn't mess anything up...",

    "7370": "Maybe I should adjust the concentration of isopropyl methylphosphonate...",
    "7371": "Is Subject 97 dead? Huh. I didn't think that was a lethal dose.",
    "7372": "I'm Nizzy, and I just transferred here today as an assistant. If you have anything that needs to be dealt with, then leave it to me.",
    "7373": "Please don't take the things I mentioned when I first arrived to heart.",
    "7374": "Captain, mind your manners in public—and that is NOT an invitation to play around in private.",
    "7375": "Where do you think you're going, Captain? Doctor Rinbell's lab is off limits.",
    "7376": "...I miss Doctor Rinbell so much.",
    "7377": "Press this button if you need anything. I'll be there in 30 seconds.",
    "7378": "There are a few issues with this room's camera angles, so I'll be making some adjustments.",

    "7383": "If there's nothing else on the agenda, I'd like to go see Doctor Rinbell.",
    "7384": "Happy birthday, Captain. I wish you many good days long into the future.",
    "7385": "Beep-beep-beep! Commencing test of kindness... Okay. Looks like you pass.",
    "7386": "Dewey thinks the melon seeds Tris brings are yucky. I think they're yucky, too!",
    "7387": "I love sweets. Got any sweets?",
    "7388": "Tris told me not to eat shampoo or soap. Hard to resist when they smell so sweet, though, huh?",
    "7389": "Drippy drip... A voice told me the weather's gonna be fair for the next few days.",
    "7390": "*sniff* You smell like my friend Kuro. I wonder how he's doing right now...",
    "7391": "These? They're part of my body, so no touching. They're sensitive.",
    "7392": "The Meat Meet sure is powerful, but sorry. I can't tell you where its secret base is.",
    "7393": "Shhh... I'm talking to someone right now.",
    "7394": "I felt a voice calling out to me... but what was it? If only you could hear it, too... It's not fair.",
    "7395": "Help myself to all this ice cream and popcorn? Can I? Wow... You're the second best person after Tris! Thanks!",
    "7396": "I wanna take a nap. Don't wake me up, 'kay?",
    "7397": "Happy birthday! Can I have a slice of your cake?",
    "7398": "Hiya! I'm one of Supreme Commander Morgan's adjutants, Millyna. I'll help you out however I can.",
    "7399": "I just want to make it clear to you, Captain: I'm a boy.",
    "7400": "I have experience with clerical work, so don't you worry about a thing!",
    "7401": "Try not to slack, Captain. But if you're really, really tired, go and get some proper rest.",
    "7402": "Would you like something to drink? I'll grab something.",
    "7403": "I also used to be part of the former Blacark mercenaries, which makes me your predecessor.",
    "7404": "Honorifics? I don't mind if we speak candidly toward one another. Really—it's okay.",
    "7405": "My afternoon break passed by so fast...",
    "7406": "I haven't listened to this CD I bought yet. I'll play it once I find time to relax.",
    "7407": "Captain, I—I want us to rebuild the Blacark together! Whatever it takes, I want to make sure I'm there for you!",
    "7408": "Huh?! B-But I'm a boy! A hundred percent boy! I thought I'd made that pretty clear before...",
    "7409": "Hello? Are you still there? Hello? ...Nothing.",
    "7410": "Happy birthday, Captain! Heh. Can't remember when I last said that to a boy.",
    "7411": "I can't wait to watch you scream. It'll be the highlight of my day.",
    "7412": "I got in a hell of a lot of trouble for killin' my old man's fish when I was little. It's such a great memory, though—the fish killin' part, that is.",
    "7413": "The screams of small animals are no longer enough to satisfy my needs.",
    "7414": "Those are some pretty eyes you've got.",
    "7415": "What items should I put together next time?",
    "7416": "Ain't no shame in putting the fear of god in people.",
    "7417": "If you want people to fear you, you have to learn them inside and out.",
    "7418": "There's all kinds of ways to inflict pain, but the kind that comes with screaming always gets me going.",
    "7419": "Don't you just love the faces of people in agony?",
    "7420": "C'mere and have a sit! I got a few fun games to play with you.",
    "7421": "You're real interesting, y'know that? I just know I'm gonna have sooo much fun puttin' you through the wringer.",
    "7422": "Come on! Let a girl have her fun, hmm?",
    "7423": "Your birthday? What makes you think I give a damn?",
    "7424": "Hello, Captain! My name's Amber, and I'm a magical girl.",
    "7425": "Hmm? You want me to do something magical? A-About that...",
    "7426": "I'm a magical girl, not an angel!",
    "7427": "There's no sweeter music in the world than a child's laughter.",
    "7428": "Do you have a favorite fairy tale, Captain?",
    "7429": "Don't you think it's sad that there's no good manga or anime in this era?",
    "7430": "The children gave me the sweetest present! I'm on cloud nine.",
    "7431": "I won't get lost again, Captain, so please take this tracker off my dress!",
    "7432": "Aww... I got kicked out of the bounty hunter's hall because everyone thought I was a child.",
    "7433": "There's an animated movie I want to go see, Captain. Will you come with me?",
    "7434": "Eeep! Umm... I-I... Sure? N-N-No! This is all going WAY too fast!",
    "7435": "Captain, are you tired? Let me read a story to you!",
    "7436": "Happy birthday, Captain! I'm all ready to show you the magical girl's way! Wha...? \"Magic isn't real\"? Oooh, don't call me out like that!",
    "7437": "It was not my intention to come here. I believe you're well aware of that.",
    "7438": "Focus on your work. No need to worry about conversing with me.",
    "7439": "You're already thinking about lunch? Well, aren't we relaxed?",
    "7440": "Those immoral male tendencies aside, you still make for a proper leader.",
    "7441": "I suppose if I sleep, I won't have to hear your nonsense.",
    "7442": "Do you need my help? Then you will be in my debt. Simple as that.",
    "7443": "You've never been afraid of me. I understand why she sent me.",
    "7444": "My abilities are... are more of a curse than a gift.",
    "7445": "I was plagued by nightmares until the day I met Haela.",
    "7446": "Even evildoers have hearts, hm? It sounds quite pretty when spoken out loud.",
    "7447": "I feel you desire me quite intensely. Pity for you that I have no interest.",
    "7448": "Very well. I'll rest right with you.",
    "7449": "My! Birthdays are always worth celebrating. I will bring you a nice little something next time—just you wait.",
    "7450": "My name is Ariel. I'm an AI, as you can see, but I would be very happy if you treated me as though I were a real human.",
    "7451": "My records show you to be very interesting, Captain.",
    "7452": "You've rubbed your thumb 189 times in the past 60 minutes. This must be a habit of yours.",
    "7453": "There are some DVDs I want to watch, Captain. Could you get them for me?",
    "7454": "Eat? I don't need to, but I'm curious about the sensation.",
    "7455": "I've seen the sea, but I haven't been able to touch it.",
    "7456": "I was created as a spare body for someone else.",
    "7457": "It's been 301 hours and 49 minutes since I last saw Aita, Captain. I miss her.",
    "7458": "How are things?",
    "7459": "Captain, I've registered you as one of my best friends.",
    "7460": "My records show this to be a confession of love, but I fear I don't understand that emotion.",
    "7461": "You've been away for more than five minutes. My records show that to be laziness.",
    "7462": "Happy birthday, Captain! I understand what you're going through. I, too, have a birthday.",
    "7463": "I've heard of you, Captain. It's rare these days to find someone with your ambition.",
    "7464": "Hmm? Well, yeah. I was the one who planned the resistance.",
    "7465": "All my efforts would have been in vain had I not met Aita.",
    "7466": "Ah⁠—those are books I'm studying. Are you interested?",
    "7467": "How would you like a history lesson on the world's wars?",
    "7468": "You're someone with ideals, so you're sure to succeed as long as you put in the effort.",
    "7469": "Circumstances are never as simple as they seem. There's bound to be someone plotting something in every nation.",
    "7470": "Do you guys have regular drinking parties here? No? Good.",
    "7471": "Even now, it's sometimes hard to believe I was part of Arita's very foundation...",
    "7472": "I see infinite potential and hope within you.",
    "7473": "As a soldier, my mind should be on my duties. Sorry I can't be more than a friend to you.",
    "7474": "Do you need rest? No problem. Leave the rest to me.",
    "7475": "Happy birthday, Captain. May you embark down a glorious path.",
    "7476": "Eggy: HELLO, FANS! How's everyone doing? Peggy: ...No one's here.",
    "7477": "Eggy: Captain, do you like small animals? Peggy: Stop bugging him.",
    "7478": "Eggy: Don't disturb Peggy while she's writing. Peggy: Do as she says, not as she does.",
    "7479": "Peggy: If I recall, Captain, you were in the war, weren't you? Eggy: Huh? He was?!",
    "7480": "Eggy: Captain, what's it like to give out orders? Peggy: I've been wondering that, too.",
    "7481": "Eggy: Captain, Captain! Are you coming to our concert? Peggy: You get in free, of course.",
    "7482": "Eggy: I love cats and Peggy loves dogs! Peggy: Yeah, but we both hate green peppers.",
    "7483": "Eggy: All our fans are getting a little too riled up! Peggy: Nah, it's totally fine! They're all sweeties.",
    "7484": "Peggy: Captain, care to share a comment on our work? Eggy: Oh! I really wanna hear this!",
    "7485": "Eggy: Peggy is my only family, so you need to take good care of her, okay? Peggy: Oh, Eggy... That should be my line.",
    "7486": "Eggy: We became idols so we could bring joy to others. We'd love it if you watch us perform sometime! Right, Peggy? \nPeggy: Definitely!",
    "7487": "Eggy: Let's go practice our dance routine! Peggy: Okie-dokie.",
    "7488": "Eggy & Peggy: Happy birthday, Captain! Eggy: This is a gift from us. Peggy: We hope you like it!",
    "7489": "Are you out of your mind? You actually come to me for help?",
    "7490": "Careful, now. I'm not her.",
    "7491": "Die.",
    "7492": "Look, you've got the wrong idea about me.",
    "7493": "What are you looking forward to?",
    "7494": "Working to understand one other is essential to bettering humanity as a whole.",
    "7495": "You're pursuing nothing more than a phantom.",
    "7496": "I don't have a body, but that doesn't mean I can't find other ways to crush you.",
    "7497": "Try all you want. I've long left those feelings behind me.",
    "7498": "Knowing that even I have the right to be happy... that thought alone completes me.",
    "7499": "Do you really think this is all right? No... I'm not dissatisfied, per se. I just—forget it. It's nothing.",
    "7500": "Even when divided, we are the same...",
    "7501": "I guess I should wish you well, so...have a safe and happy year.",
    "7502": "Sup?",
    "7503": "What's up?",
    "7504": "Screw off.",
    "7505": "Whoa!",
    "7506": "Can it.",
    "7507": "I get'cha.",
    "7508": "What do you want?",
    "7509": "Okay.",
    "7510": "New orders?",
    "7511": "Mmm... Mmm... Yum! The food here's delicious.",
    "7512": "If you want me to talk, you better pay up.",
    "7513": "Mrm... Nothin' to do.",
    "7514": "Happy birthday.",
    "7515": "Hello, Captain. I look forward to learning more from you in the future.",
    "7516": "My body? It's not much different, really.",
    "7517": "I hope you won't pay Alexa's antics much mind, Captain.",
    "7518": "Noctris says you're a trustworthy person.",
    "7519": "I owe my life to Noctris.",
    "7520": "I think you know that some technologies in this world are not of this era.",
    "7521": "This body was made for battle.",
    "7522": "Sumora is a tremendous designer.",
    "7523": "I'm way happier in Hexel than I ever was in the empire.",
    "7524": "If... If I'd met you earlier, what would I be like now?",
    "7525": "Thank you, Captain! I know you don't bestow this honor upon just anyone. I'm so happy!",
    "7526": "So quiet now...",
    "7527": "Happy birthday, Captain. Look at you, growing up right before our eyes.",
    "7528": "Arita's unsung criminal investigator, Trang, is here and ready to get to work!",
    "7529": "Any interest in detective novels?",
    "7530": "How about I recommend some detective games to you?",
    "7531": "Arita's lookin' pretty secure as far as I can tell.",
    "7532": "Ahhh... It'd sure be nice if our leader were a beautiful girl instead.",
    "7533": "To be honest, courtrooms are kinda boring.",
    "7534": "I used to be a soldier, too.",
    "7535": "Kristina knows just about everything! She's my idol!",
    "7536": "My dream is to become a private detective once I retire.",
    "7537": "Thanks for giving me this job, Captain!",
    "7538": "Y'know what, Captain? I want to see what the world's like through your eyes!",
    "7539": "You tuckered out?",
    "7540": "Happy birthday, Captain. I hope this coming year is jam-packed with all kinds of twists and turns for you.",
    "7541": "Hi! I'm Vivine, a commanding officer for Kegha's border security. Do you like reading novels, by any chance?",
    "7542": "Whenever I'm at a loss for ideas, I just go outside and take a walk.",
    "7543": "It's not good to push yourself too hard. You need to relax.",
    "7544": "Do you ever read novels, Captain?",
    "7545": "Yes? What can I do for you?",
    "7546": "Everyone on the team drinks coffee, but I just can't get used to the taste.",
    "7547": "Captain, what would you recommend to help reduce stress?",
    "7548": "Are there any scenic places you'd recommend I visit, Captain?",
    "7549": "Some other Captains have been coming to me to talk around their love problems, but I, uh... I've never been in love. Haha...",
    "7550": "I'd like you to try this special health drink I made for you, Captain. Go on! It's your favorite flavor.",
    "7551": "Huh? Being in... love? Well, I've never BEEN in love before, so... Wait. You think we—we belong together?",
    "7552": "A proper rest is the best medicine for recovering your focus.",
    "7553": "Happy birthday, Captain. Would you like to see the short story I wrote for you?",
    "7554": "No need to pull out all the stops with me, friend. I'm Alexa Nelly—nothing more, nothing less.",
    "7555": "I'm not tryin' to change your mind, but just remember that the reward isn't always worth the risk.",
    "7556": "You know I'm here for you and all, but I've got my principles.",
    "7557": "If possible, I'd like to avoid any conflicts with anyone.",
    "7558": "I truly benefit from the way you always think outside the box.",
    "7559": "This scar? It's from a little fire at the place I lived in as a kid.",
    "7560": "You're a good man, but I can live without your attention.",
    "7561": "What an intriguing proposal... Let's party, then.",
    "7562": "I'm on your side no matter what.",
    "7563": "Wasn't expecting you to be so stupid, but stupidity is cute in it's own way.",
    "7564": "Hahaha! You have one hell of a sense of humor. Been a while since I've felt so happy.",
    "7565": "Hope you won't mind me stepping out for a moment. I have some personal matters to attend to.",
    "7566": "Oh? Didn't know it was your birthday till just now. I'll keep that in mind for next year.",
    "7567": "Hello! Step right up and take the card that represents your destiny!",
    "7568": "Fortune teller? No, no. I'm a magician.",
    "7569": "Micromagic happens to be my forte.",
    "7570": "Nuh-uh! A magician never reveals her secrets.",
    "7571": "Street performances are a true test of one's abilities.",
    "7572": "You want to know where I've put my things? Sorry! That's a secret.",
    "7573": "What one sees with the naked eye may well be an illusion.",
    "7574": "Oh, I used to hang out with the knights, you know.",
    "7575": "I love catching that look of surprise from my audience.",
    "7576": "My name isn't Brie! It's Breeze!",
    "7577": "Captain, you are simply lovely. I like you!",
    "7578": "Mind if I rest for a bit?",
    "7579": "Happy birthday, Captain! Ready to watch my amazing magic show?",
    "7580": "Hey. Think you could step off?",
    "7581": "You won't like the way I greet your face if you take one more step.",
    "7582": "Leave me alone, trash.",
    "7583": "Think you could knock that off?",
    "7584": "Don't say a damn word.",
    "7585": "See where your command post is? Just stand over there.",
    "7586": "Better remember to show Alexa respect.",
    "7587": "You've got one second to talk to me—ONE.",
    "7588": "Shut up! I'm trying to read.",
    "7589": "Don't touch. My yo-yos are important to me.",
    "7590": "I think you're running into a dead end with whatever this is.",
    "7591": "This bit of peace and quiet is just what I need.",
    "7592": "Happy birthday. You're, uh...pretty dope as far as a captains go, I guess. Here.",
    "7593": "Oh? Aha! So YOU'RE the new mercenary captain I'm always hearing about.",
    "7594": "Got a hell of a base here! Color me envious!",
    "7595": "Do you know any equipment mod specialists?",
    "7596": "I got some brand-spankin' new wine right here. You up for a glass?",
    "7597": "The way you act sometimes reminds me of a lil' brat who's used to having his way.",
    "7598": "Tsk. This wine tastes like I'm downing medicine. What a lousy flavor.",
    "7599": "You and Kristina're pretty chummy. What's the nature of your relationship?",
    "7600": "There's some real nice nuggets of info floatin' around in ComiBoni.",
    "7601": "The folks at the guild're lazy as they come. Do they ever get up off their asses?",
    "7602": "I won't stop until I find who I'm looking for.",
    "7603": "I don't mind us being pals, but I'm already married to revenge. ...What? Don't laugh.",
    "7604": "You mind if I look up some more gigs?",
    "7605": "Happy birthday, Captain! Just remember that bounties don't take a day off, even if you do.",
    "7606": "Nice to meet you. I'm Sumora, and I look forward to our future partnership.",
    "7607": "I'm very interested in all the machinery you keep around Felix.",
    "7608": "Noctris' creativity is far beyond my imagination.",
    "7609": "It's thanks to Noctris that I can do my job with ease.",
    "7610": "I don't like fighting, but combat prowess is necessary in this day and age.",
    "7611": "I like my mechanized arm, to be honest. Perhaps getting it was a blessing in disguise.",
    "7612": "I've seen quite a few curious machines that look like they're from another era.",
    "7613": "Chilino? I think of her as a very dependable colleague.",
    "7614": "Feel free to let me know if you have any designs in mind.",
    "7615": "What is it? I'll help with whatever I can.",
    "7616": "\"Best friends,\" huh? I've always wanted one.",
    "7617": "Rest well.",
    "7618": "Happy birthday, Captain. Take care of yourself in the coming year.",
    "7619": "Oh? Are you the one who claims to be the Blacark's successor?",
    "7620": "Why are you obsessed with that title?",
    "7621": "You recall that we were enemies once, I hope?",
    "7622": "The Blacark's formation was but the result of the empire's tyranny.",
    "7623": "Queen Lisa is... not the reprehensible woman many think she is.",
    "7624": "This world is too lenient with the weak.",
    "7625": "You don't need to know what I'm thinking.",
    "7626": "General Hammer? No longer with us, I am afraid.",
    "7627": "The glory of the Tetraknights has long been diminished.",
    "7628": "No matter how much time passes, some things never change.",
    "7629": "Friends? That means nothing to me.",
    "7630": "What a carefree fellow you are.",
    "7631": "Happy birthday, young man. Keep pushing forward.",
    "7632": "I've heard an awful lot about you, Captain. Now, why not be a doll and help me out of these damn handcuffs?",
    "7633": "Just look at how conspicuous I am. How could lil' old me get away with stealing?",
    "7634": "I'd prefer it if you didn't stare so much.",
    "7635": "These handcuffs? All part of my signature look! Heh. But they aren't. Seriously.",
    "7636": "I kinda dig the jailhouse look. Kidding, of course.",
    "7637": "These things can't be broken with brute force. Well...at least not without killing me.",
    "7638": "You don't believe in superstitions involving people with heterochromia, do you, Captain?",
    "7639": "Hmm? You want me to return it? So this… is something I shouldn't take?",
    "7640": "If I position it juuust right, this chain here could easily strangle someone.",
    "7641": "As soon as I wake up in the morning, I try to find a way to make myself smile.",
    "7642": "You're a sweetie, Captain, but I don't plan to spend my life with anyone.",
    "7643": "Hmm... Could do with some entertainment.",
    "7644": "Happy birthday, Captain! This is your gift. Promise I didn't steal it.",
    "7645": "Well, aren't you a cute face? If you need some help, you can always reach out to me.",
    "7646": "I wasn't expecting our captain to be such a delicious-looking young man.",
    "7647": "Bounty hunting may be my line of work, but it's far from all I can do.",
    "7648": "The girls here are all so adorable. Oh, how I envy them!",
    "7649": "Even boys should take care to look their very best.",
    "7650": "I'm certain you'll grow into one fine specimen in the future, Captain.",
    "7651": "Don't treat me like a stranger. Go on. Say my name: \"Jasmine.\"",
    "7652": "Have you heard any rumors about me? Take a guess.",
    "7653": "Didn't you know? To be a woman is to be a creature of mystery.",
    "7654": "Are you tired? Come here and rest.",
    "7655": "Oh! Well, aren't you just the sweetest... It's been a long time since a man's pursued me.",
    "7656": "You look so irresistibly cute when you're nodding off, Captain.",
    "7657": "Today is a special day indeed. Happy birthday, Captain.",
    "7658": "Ooogh... Auugh... Heehee! Just kidding. I'm not that kind of zombie.",
    "7659": "What is it? Something caught your eye?",
    "7660": "First time seeing a real zombie, huh?",
    "7661": "Oh! You mean this stuff on my head? I stuck 'em in just for fun.",
    "7662": "Hmm... My prison number used to be pinned to my uniform.",
    "7663": "Only the empire could turn a human into something like me.",
    "7664": "Is it okay for any of my zombie friends to swing by?",
    "7665": "After being here for a while, I kinda miss my old life in my cell...",
    "7666": "You probably shouldn't touch that bag if you want to live.",
    "7667": "I look sad? Well, yeah. I'm very sad. But what's the point? I can't even shed tears.",
    "7668": "How do I feel? Don't you already know, Captain?",
    "7669": "For you I will now perform... a special amputation.",
    "7670": "Happy birthday! Will you celebrate my undeath-day once it comes around, too?",
    "7671": "Hello, Captain. Don't you worry! Just treat me like you would a normal girl.",
    "7672": "Are my horns really that weird...?",
    "7673": "I really like this cap.",
    "7674": "I—I don't want to talk about what happened.",
    "7675": "Sorry! Did you say something? I was caught up in this book.",
    "7676": "Wanna try the cake I baked, Captain?",
    "7677": "...I'm not sure what else I'm good for outside of piloting.",
    "7678": "What is life like for ordinary people?",
    "7679": "This weather is just perfect for a nap.",
    "7680": "I think I'm one step closer to my dream. Want to guess what it is?",
    "7681": "I-I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. Just... Oh, boy. I really am at a loss for words.",
    "7682": "May I visit the school nearby, Captain?",
    "7683": "Happy birthday, Captain. It's all you now, and it's only just the beginning!",
    "7684": "Patricia told me not to talk to strangers...but I'm here now.",
    "7685": "Have you seen Patricia?",
    "7686": "Where's Flavia?",
    "7687": "Karan's gonna scold you if you don't eat dinner on time.",
    "7688": "I wanna play outside!",
    "7689": "I miss the taste of the milk I'd drink back home.",
    "7690": "Come here and play with me, Captain!",
    "7691": "Murasaki said that if there's any trouble, I should come straight to you! She said you can do anything!",
    "7692": "This toy is mine! You can't have it.",
    "7693": "Captain, how'd you like to go to the amusement park with me?",
    "7694": "Are we gonna be super friends? Then will you play with me and buy me food?",
    "7695": "Ngh... I'm getting sleepy...",
    "7696": "Happy birthday, Captain. I got a present for you!",
    "7697": "Heya, kiddo. You in the market for a little special something?",
    "7698": "What're you buying? I have everything you could possibly need!",
    "7699": "If you want it, I'll make sure to stock it.",
    "7700": "You're looking real fit there, kiddo.",
    "7701": "Integrity is the crux of good business. Understood?",
    "7702": "Now, now. It's not polite to ask where the goods came from.",
    "7703": "I have supply channels all over the world. Tell me what you want, and I can find it.",
    "7704": "Just so you know, none of my goods come cheap.",
    "7705": "Shush! These are meant to be top secret!",
    "7706": "Wanna know my current hideout? I'll tell you only.",
    "7707": "Boy, oh, boy! You don't know how badly I want to turn you into my personal commodity.",
    "7708": "Are you satisfied?",
    "7709": "Happy birthday, Captain! As a special treat, how about a today-only special of 1% off all goods?",
    "7710": "Hello, little one. Rumor has it you're the new captain of the Blacark.",
    "7711": "Have you any experience growing flowers?",
    "7712": "Don't be so nervous. I haven't the slightest interest in doing anything to you.",
    "7713": "The atmosphere here is far more pleasing than I expected.",
    "7714": "It's impolite to stare at someone's face for so long.",
    "7715": "You're like an open book, kiddo.",
    "7716": "Does my cane fascinate you? Flavia made it.",
    "7717": "I wish to see how well you perform under pressure.",
    "7718": "My leg makes it difficult for me to walk. I hope you'll take that into consideration.",
    "7719": "How many more days do we have like this...?",
    "7720": "I sense you're much more determined than those cowards.",
    "7721": "I ought to go check on Yvette.",
    "7722": "Happy birthday. May the flowers deep within your soul bloom in full.",
    "7723": "Coral: Heh! Go on—work Evie to the bone! Evelynn: Easy for you to say when you don't have a body...",
    "7724": "Coral: I think your captain's up to something naughty. Evelynn: Just ignore him.",
    "7725": "Evelynn: Body or digitized, you don't get a free pass to touch. Coral: Haha! You're silly, Captain.",
    "7726": "Coral: You, are committing a love crime.\nEvelynn: He'll be imprisoned for life.",
    "7727": "Coral: Say, Evie? How's it feel to get pats on the head? Evelynn: ...",
    "7728": "Coral: Aww! Look at you two! Evelynn: Butt out!",
    "7729": "Coral: Evie might not notice, but your eyes are aaall over her, huh?",
    "7730": "Coral: So you two are that close now? Evelynn: N-No, we aren't...",
    "7731": "Coral: Must be awfully nice... Evelynn: You. Shut. Up.",
    "7732": "Coral: Oh, Captain! I love you! Evelynn: Hold up. I didn't say ANYTHING like that, got it?",
    "7733": "Coral: Hmm... \nEvelynn: What's up? \nCoral: So...is this, like...polygamy?\nEvelynn: Try to curb that imagination of yours.",
    "7734": "Coral: Captain, did you know that Evie— Evelynn: Stop! STOP! I told you not to tell anyone!",
    "7735": "Happy birthday, Captain! We can't wait to spend all of next year with you.",
    "7736": "Pleasantries. My name is Lollar.",
    "7737": "The weather is very sunny today.",
    "7738": "I have no recreational pastimes.",
    "7739": "Request error. I do not understand.",

In terms of performance, though, Phoenix is vastly superior, as she was created after the process had been more refined. After rigorous testing, she was deemed capable of safely interacting with others and was assigned to the Kegha army, where she quickly climbed to the rank of major.\nBefore Phoenix underwent modification, she was a rather hotheaded and cheery girl. While most of that still remains, having parts of her brain augmented and replaced with machinery has made her much calmer—not that she is complaining.\nLike many of Agnes's test subjects, Phoenix was originally an orphan. She retains a genuine loyalty to Agnes and willingly follow her.\nThanks to her training, Phoenix has managed to hide her superhuman abilities and blend perfectly into human society—which means Agnes's experiment is finally ready to enter its next phase.

After the Steel Witch arrived in Hexel, Patti became the leader of the Watcher family. Now, she uses her abilities to contribute to her country and family alike.\nPossessing a massive sweet tooth, Patti can almost always be found chewing on bubble gum.\nShe generally leans toward light and casual attire that shows plenty of skin. In her free time, she likes to take pictures of beautiful scenery.",
    "9012": "A native of Hexel and the leader of Judgment Star, Cynthia is the second daughter of the Braddon family.\nAfter her father died, her uncle framed her and murdered her older sister. She was then forced by her uncle to relinquish her succession rights, or her younger sister may die. After becoming the head of the house, her uncle's wickedness only grew, and he imprisoned Cynthia's younger sister. Cynthia was exiled to the slums, where helplessness slowly turned into hatred. She swore to get her revenge.\nBut the Braddon house simply vanished later. No one knows what happened, and the woman named Cynthia Braddon was never seen again.\nAs the leader of the Condemners' family, Cynthia is always elegant, but no one knows her history. They only know she has a little sister who has been in hospital for as long as one can remember. For as much as she cares about her teammates—and indeed, they're very much a second family to her—she can't help but tease them at every opportunity.\nBlack tea is Cynthia's favorite pleasure in life and anyone who catches a whiff of the aroma from her brews is lulled to sleep. Her love of tea has also inspired a love for tea-related pastries. For as much as she loves tea, though, Cynthia detests coffee and anything that tastes like it.\nShe's a talented commander whose unusual tactics often leave teammates and enemies controlled. Still, when things get dangerous, Cynthia's the first to take to the battlefield herself",
    "9013": "An orphan born in the desert of Hexel, shunned all her life due to rumors of being cursed. Supposedly, her parents died as the result of this curse, and the whispers surrounding her say anyone who draws near will inevitably meet with a terrible end.\nThese rumors made Sura's childhood even more difficult, and she eventually became so lonely and depressed that she was ready to give up on life. Things began to look a bit brighter when she was given the chance to join the Condemner family, where for the first time in her life she met people who were completely unconcerned about the silly rumors surrounding her and welcomed her with open arms.\nPerhaps due to her petite stature, Sura is a quiet, reserved girl who rarely speaks and avoids noisy places. Unfortunately, this means that, on the rare occasion that she does talk, she tends to startle those around her.\nShe holds an odd fascination with objects related to traditional witches, and collects them whenever she has the chance. She's never seen without her broom and keeps a black cat as a pet. According to the handful of people who have seen her house, she's even collected a whole shelf full of spell books and covered the floor in arcane circles and sigils.",

    "10984": "Yes, a base.",
    "10985": "It was badly damaged in battle, but it's ours now.",
    "10986": "So this scrap was sent to us as what, some kind of souvenir?",
    "10987": "Well... it's not beyond repair.",
    "10988": "You say that, but why's it so dark here? Can't someone turn on the lights?",
    "10989": "Sorry, the power doesn't work.",
    "10990": "No wonder it was free.",
    "10991": "Maybe there's treasure hidden inside; just like in the movies!",

    "10993": "Calm down, Rebeyrca.",
    "10994": "Fiiine. At any rate, looks like the Power Supply Room is fried.",
    "10995": "Guess we'll just have to work in the dark.",
    "10996": "Although you said that, I can't see your remorse.",
    "10997": "Actually, it should be possible to repair the Power Supply Room.",
    "10998": "Oh? Then let's talk about it, how should we fix this?",
    "10999": "But we'll need more hands.",
    "11000": "Hey, Evelynn. I'm here to help.",
    "11001": "Perfect timing. We just so happen to be shorthanded.",
    "11002": "Let's begin. To repair the Power Supply Room, we need crystal ore, aerogel, and source metal.",
    "11003": "The power is back.",
    "11004": "But there's likely damage in other places as well, so be prepared.",
    "11005": "That can't be helped. I just hope the rest of the base isn't as bad as this...",
    "11006": "Don't worry, I can take care of the room.",
    "11007": "Thanks.",
    "11008": "I knew it...",
    "11009": "The damage is worse than I expected.",
    "11010": "*sigh* You know what they say: Nothing worthwhile is ever easy.",
    "11011": "This looks like the water supply room.",
    "11012": "It boasts a full set of automated facilities...",
    "11013": "But the water circulation system is completely out of order.",
    "11014": "Can it be repaired?",
    "11015": "I mean... We CAN fix it, right, Veronica?",
    "11016": "Of course. And since you seem so interested, I'll leave the repairs to you.",
    "11017": "Wait, wha...?",
    "11018": "Ah... I quite like this plan.",
    "11019": "...Ugh. Fine.",
    "11020": "To repair this, I'll need a system disk, nanotubes, and the blueprint.",
    "11021": "You actually did it!",
    "11022": "According to V, these automated production systems are standard-issue, but they're used for many different things.",
    "11023": "Hehe... You look so funny trying to imitate Veronica! Hahaha!",
    "11024": "Umm... Okay?",
    "11025": "Hmph...",
    "11026": "I'd better go check on the performance of the water circulation system again.",
    "11027": "This is so weird...",
    "11028": "This must be the dormitory.",
    "11029": "Obviously.",
    "11030": "Yup, it's a dormitory alright.",
    "11031": "Let's get it repaired so we can stay here!",
    "11032": "I sure hope your enthusiasm lasts until we start cleaning the rooms.",
    "11033": "...Let's worry about that later.",
    "11034": "We have to make good use of this bad boy!",
    "11035": "Right, Captain?",
    "11036": "It'd be nice if we had a professional here right now.",
    "11037": "Hey, everyone. Please, allow me to help with this mess.",
    "11038": "I'm a pro at cleaning!",
    "11039": "To repair the dormitory, I'll need some high-pressure wires, liquid metal, and cotton velvet.",
    "11040": "Phew! I'm FINALLY done!",
    "11041": "Hey, what's the cotton velvet for? Getting my hands on that was a real hassle.",
    "11042": "We use it to make blankets.",
    "11043": "B-Blankets?!",
    "11044": "I... I thought it was for something a bit more... useful.",
    "11045": "Why? Cotton velvet makes for the absolute best blankets!",
    "11046": "Wait a sec... This kinda reminds me of that plushie Evelynn always has.",
    "11047": "Evelynn, what's your teddy bear doing here?",
    "11048": "Don't be dumb, Bex. I have a bunch of them.",
    "11049": "That's... a bit too much, even for you.",
    "11050": "This is beyond messy.",
    "11051": "Just look at all the damaged equipment...",
    "11052": "Huh? Something wrong, Veronica?",
    "11053": "This is... the intelligence room.",
    "11054": "Evelynn, look! V's eyes are sparkling.",
    "11055": "Happens every time she hears the word intelligence.",
    "11056": "The damage isn't that serious. This equipment should be easy to repair.",
    "11057": "I'll help you sort this stuff out.",
    "11058": "I'll be fine on my own. I might miss something if you guys get involved.",
    "11059": "Oh, o-okay.",
    "11060": "But I need some Bits for the repair. Can you get them for me?",
    "11061": "Getting this machinery to work again will benefit us greatly.",
    "11062": "To repair the intelligence room, I'll need a super chip, some super material, and some restoration fluid.",
    "11063": "It's done!",
    "11064": "Now let's see how this baby gathers intelligence!",
    "11065": "Evelynn, you're up early. And here I slept in...",
    "11066": "The cotton velvet blanket is just too comfy!",
    "11067": "What kind of job is it this time?",
    "11068": "Not sure. Veronica's still in the intelligence room.",
    "11069": "She's gonna become some kinda info dump monster if she's not careful.",
    "11070": "What, her? A monster? Hahaha!",
    "11071": "The \"info dump monster\" has arrived.",
    "11072": "Aaaagh!!",
    "11073": "Ignore her, V. So, what do we need to do?",
    "11074": "Other than the daily chores, we need to continue repairing the rooms.",
    "11075": "Thanks to your help, we're making good progress.",
    "11076": "Today we're going to repair the Recycling Room. I've asked someone to help us.",
    "11077": "Huh... I wonder who that might be.",
    "11078": "Hello, Evelynn! I'm here to help!",
    "11079": "Ahh... Millyna.",
    "11080": "Yup! I hope I can be of some help to you all.",
    "11081": "And for that, I'm going to need aerogel, a nanotube, and a blueprint.",
    "11082": "The repair is complete.",
    "11083": "As expected of Millyna.",
    "11084": "Hehe... Thanks, but I'm just happy to help.",
    "11085": "Shall we test the Recycling Room then?",
    "11086": "V, you called?",
    "11087": "Yes, Evelynn.",
    "11088": "This room needs to be repaired as well?",
    "11089": "That's right, but where's Rebeyrca?",
    "11090": "She's been working non-stop for the past few days. She's still sleeping due to fatigue.",
    "11091": "Nah, I'm here. Sorry... overslept.",
    "11092": "Do you want to rest a bit more? There's no hurry.",
    "11093": "I'm fine. I know how important this work is.",
    "11094": "Let's get started.",
    "11095": "Right. Let's start, V.",
    "11096": "Alright then, since you all have decided. This is the garage.",
    "11097": "And today we happen to have a special guest helping us out.",
    "11098": "Good day. I was invited to lend a hand.",
    "11099": "Grave?",
    "11100": "I don't mind taking a break from managing the army to do a little repair work.",
    "11101": "That's too much for \"a little\"...",
    "11102": "To repair the garage, we'll need super material, crystal ore, and restoration fluid.",
    "11103": "That's Grave for ya! Talk about fast.",
    "11104": "It was just a simple fix. Now let's test it out.",
    "11105": "Yeah, turn it on.",
    "11106": "This is the last room, everyone.",
    "11107": "Finally...",
    "11108": "After this, Felix will be fully functional.",
    "11109": "That's right, this will be OUR base from now on.",
    "11110": "Let's get it done together—for the Blacark mercenaries and the captain.",
    "11111": "Hahaha! I'm all pumped up!",
    "11112": "Let's not waste any time. Who's our guest this time?",
    "11113": "You can't repair the development lab without me.",
    "11114": "I've always wanted a place to test my theories.",
    "11115": "I need a system disk, a super chip, and source metal.",

Out of respect for her talents, Haela instead tends to give her more administrative duties like mission assignment, member management, and data organization. Though it involves dealing with strangers, Dolores finds the arrangement to be quite favorable overall—as well as perfectly suited for someone with the ability to read minds.\nWhile Dolores' power is certainly useful now, it caused her no end of pain during her childhood. And through all of that suffering, her sister, Jill, was always there to comfort her. The two sisters were all the family they had, and were naturally inseparable. So when Jill vanished without a trace, Dolores was utterly devastated. Desperate to find her sister, Dolores set out on her own with little idea of where to even begin looking. To make matters worse, most mercenary units scoffed at the mere suggestion of searching for \"some random girl.\" With traditional channels proving themselves useless, Dolores had no choice but to seek help from the underworld. And so, she found herself on Paranoid's doorsteps.\nIn her free time, Dolores enjoys reading and playing games—neither of which her ability can interfere with. While her empath abilities generally make her rather anti-social, she can (and often does) grow quite fond of the people around her, which she displays by playing pranks on those she likes. Since Paranoid is one of the few places where she feels safe, it's only natural she'd be so partial to Haela—but this does mean she's at the top of the list when it comes to Dolores's pranks!\n",

Once there, she blossomed into an even more gifted combatant and tactician, with her mastery of her family's traditional swordsmanship style elevating her above many of her peers.\nWhen the Imperial War broke out, arrangements were quickly made to send her home, but she insisted on staying. By joining the battle as a mercenary she not only made ample use of everything she had been taught, but gained a wealth of experience when it came to actual warfare.\nAfter the war, Rin left for Arita, where she joined the Bounty Hunters' Guild and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming third overall among its members. While her bounty score itself was merely average, her incredible talents made her the most requested bounty hunter in the region. \nAt some point two years ago, Rin and the eldest daughter of the Kujyou family crossed blades, with Rin emerging victorious. Few know the details of this encounter, but there are no end to rumors of a potential rematch looming in the horizon.\nRin's composed and sometimes even cold demeanor has captured the hearts of many—no small number of whom are other girls. \nSince she has completely cut ties with her family, she is now free to live her life however she pleases.\nIncidentally, she likes to spend her free time at Kristina's bar with Leigh, whom she considers a friend. Unfortunately, this feeling may not be mutual.\n",

While searching for Murasaki, she wound up rescuing a girl who had fallen by the side of the road. Even though this girl, Yvette, had lost her memory, Karan could tell her will was strong.\nWhen Karan learned that that Murasaki had joined Flavia's team, she took Yvette along to visit her.\nKaran may be quiet and composed, but her love of robots goes beyond a mere hobby. Despite this, she has an uncanny ability to remain levelheaded in the midst of her teammates' antics, and in fact loves to tease them whenever she gets the chance. Still, she's considered one of the most \"normal\" members of the team. And despite how demanding her daily life may be, she handles herself well.\nKaran cares a lot for Murasaki, even though she doesn't always show it.

She loves nothing more than to torture her victims in every way imaginable, all so she can bask in their cries of anguish. Still, proper torture requires preparation, and Yogui cuts no corners when it comes to researching her marks. As a result, her knowledge of the Paranoid mercenary unit might exceed even Haela's.\nAlthough her interest in matters other than torture is nearly nonexistent, she has been known to play a melody or two on the many instruments she learned as a child. Supposedly, she has mastered more than twenty musical instruments—though no one has been brave enough to ask her what those are.",

Amused, Patricia opted to keep it, and the name stuck—much to the despair of Murasaki and Karan.\nUnlike other mercenary units, the Health and Happiness Sisterhood contingent takes on a wide variety of requests, which has earned them a reputation for accepting any job, regardless of how boring or mundane it might be. Despite this, none of the members have ever complained about the situation.\nBefore establishing the team, Flavia was the head instructor at Firbolg Academy— an institute known for training the empire's most elite soldiers. What it isn't known for is its secret research division dedicated to human modification experiments and weapon development. And, naturally, leading those efforts as head researcher was none other than Flavia. \nHaving studied under Rinbell and performed her own trials in human experimentation, Flavia was determined to take her research to the next level. But her dreams of innovation came crashing down when her fellow researcher and friend Patricia lost her right leg in an experiment gone horribly wrong.\nAs both a researcher and mech test pilot, Patricia's injury meant a severe disruption to the division's activity. And so, she was given an offer—become a test subject herself in order to either gain a substitute leg, or serve as fodder to learn from in case of failure. Without any hesitation, Flavia refused to allow it. Realizing that she couldn't take on the entire academy, though, and not wanting to bring any more pain to her friend, Flavia disappeared—but not before causing quite a stir on her way out.",
    "13191": "When Qiao Xi was a little girl, she watched helplessly as bandits murdered her parents, powerless to do anything but hide beneath her bed and burn the culprits' faces into her memory. That moment shaped her into a person who hates evil, hates those who don't act against evil, and—most of all—hates the world full of conflict and suffering she finds herself trapped in. With no other options, she realized she'd have to take justice into her own hands and began training day and night to do exactly that.\nAfter years of training and preparation, she finally exacted vengeance in a manner that can only be described as incredibly explosive. But while fleeing from the blast, she was knocked off her feet and smacked her head, losing her memories. Freed from the image of her parents being killed, she transformed overnight into a cheery, energetic girl excited to see everything life has to offer.\nDespite the loss of her memories, her desire to eradicate evil remains as fierce as ever. Combined with her newfound optimism, Qiao Xi channels that fervor to strike fear into the hearts of criminals everywhere. She's known as a hero who fights violence with even more violence, and remains unbridled in her pursuit of justice.",
    "13192": "Rosa is a woman shrouded in mystery—so much so that few even know of her existence. While she possesses incredible power, she rarely displays it, preferring instead to spend all her time deep within her research lab. Sometimes, she even takes a break from her lengthy gaming sessions to actually do some research. In addition to researching technology, she has a keen interest in game development. So much so that, according to some, nearly half of all recently released games were actually developed by her. How she has the time for that is anyone's guess, but the current best hypothesis is that time must flow differently within her lab—which does quite a bit to explain her rather peculiar priorities.\nWhile Rosa is undeniably eccentric and more than a little proud of her abilities, she rarely actually speaks about herself. Only those who have personally met her can hope to understand the person behind the strange technology and one-woman game studio she has brought into the world. \nBut those who have speak of a woman who often looks like she was up all night playing games.\nRosa's lab is hidden by optical camouflage, but there have been raids when a passerby stumbled in. The fate of the intruder rests solely on Rosa's mood at that moment—whether she's friendly or coldly disposes of them seems very much up to luck. Interestingly, it seems that all of those allowed to leave alive are beautiful women...",
    "13193": "When it comes to loving food, Brittany has few equals—give her half a chance, and you can bet she'll be happily scarfing down food with reckless abandon. After years of this, though, she realized that ordinary dishes could no longer satisfy her highly honed taste buds. There was only one thing for her to do: start cooking her very own dishes.\nSince that day, Brittany has dedicated herself to the culinary arts, traveling far and wide to learn about the many delicacies cooked around the world. By the time she returned to her hometown, she had become an outstanding chef. Not only that, but she had come to discover a fundamental truth of food and cooking—no matter the dish, food just tastes better when someone else cooks it.\nBrittany is a cheery and enthusiastic person, which means when something piques her interest she dives right in with a zeal that leaves her eagerly asking questions. This passion for learning and her general positive attitude often rub off on those around her—even nobles have become fans of her upbeat demeanor and outstanding cooking. It's to the point where even the haughtiest among them can't get enough of her mouthwatering dishes, which is no small feat.\nIn case it wasn't obvious, Brittany is a bit of a foodie, so be sure to keep that in mind if you're ever on cooking duty.\n",
    "13194": "Krista and Eloise are without a doubt two of the most recognized generals in all of the empire—if not the entire continent. But while they both serve the imperial army, their battle styles couldn't be any more different. Whereas Krista staunchly carries out orders with a brutal efficiency, Eloise has a tendency to question or even voice dissent toward the orders she receives. Unlike Krista, Eloise always tries to avoid using extreme measures in her missions, though her attempts are usually unsuccessful. If Eloise is the Valkyrie of Kegha, then Krista is its God of War—and if the two were to ever face off in battle, she would more than live up to that title.\nBorn in the slums of the empire and desperate to survive, Krista and Eloise were captured and branded with tattoos on their faces to ensure they would never fully escape their bitter origins. Despite this, though, the two barely even notice these markings, and when they do, they consider them to be symbols of how far they've come together. And indeed, it was only because they had each other that they were able to make it through those bleak years of desperately trying to survive until the next day.\nThough she would never admit it to anyone else, Eloise is the most important person in Krista's world. Believing that their personalities should complement one another, Krista went out of her way to cultivate different interests and earn accolades of her own—all so that she could continue to earn a place at Eloise's side. \nSo when Eloise took in Bernadette, Krista felt little more than disdain toward the girl, though she wasn't exactly sure what caused that feeling or even how to properly describe it. Naturally, Krista's behavior has created a rather uneasy distance between herself and Eloise, but through it all, Krista has never once stopped thinking about Eloise. While Krista is greatly troubled by her own increasingly cruel behavior, she keeps this to herself and continues living in the only way she knows.\n",
    "13195": "Even from an early age, Amane has always shown an incredible talent for music. Before long, her hard work brought her to stages all over the Thousand Island Nation, where she became enamored with the thrill of the stage. After her first truly massive show, she vowed to one day bring her songs to the furthest corners of the world.\nBut life is full of surprises, and not all of them are kind. On Amane's eighteenth birthday, war broke out across the islands, lasting three long years. During this time, Amane's career stalled, and her family was eventually forced to abandon their home and flee to safety. Denied her dream but in no way beaten, Amane changed gears, channeling her vigor and sense of justice into becoming a soldier who fought to bring peace back to the Thousand Islands.\n...The more she fought, though, the more she realized her own naivety. Bit by bit, war shattered everything she had once thought true about the world—and, eventually, even herself. She had simply coasted through life for eighteen years, but now that seemed like little more than the calm before the storm. When the war finally ended, all of her doubts were chased away the moment she returned to the stage. Touched by the fans who came to see her, she was convinced that music truly did have the power to change the world.\nShe's currently busy preparing for her very first world tour, and it won't be long before her beautiful melodies are heard in every corner of Necklyeth.",

Her own abilities, combined with Arita's advanced medical technology, enable her to quickly stabilize any patient, regardless of how dangerous the surroundings. Unfortunately, there are few opportunities for her to display the full extent of her skills—while injuries among her teammates are common, few of them are ever more severe than bruises or scratches. As a result, Aurora tends to busy herself by tending to damaged mechs. Since her team operates with as few people as possible, it falls to her to complete critical repairs—often braving enemy fire on the field to do so. While she presents herself as merely logistics personnel, she clearly puts her heart and soul into every part of her job.\nDuring her free time, Aurora enjoys taking walks through parks and forests, where she can take a breath of fresh air. On windy days, she likes to fly kites in wide, open spaces.\nShe's also rather obsessed with cleanliness, frequently scrubbing down the mechs and even sanitizing her hands afterwards.\nHer code name is \"Nurse.\"\n",

She is, in short, a (very friendly) walking disaster.\n",
    "14467": "Once a powerful gang leader in Derrian, the empire's capital, Solveig's whole life was changed forever when she was beaten to a pulp by Flavia after bullying one of her students. But instead of seeking vengeance, Solveig ended up falling for Flavia's strength and confidence, and has since become obsessed. Or, \"Flavia's biggest fan,\" as she would put it. In Solveig's eyes, Flavia can do no wrong, and any word that leaves her mouth is nothing less than the words of a sage. Sometimes, even so much as meeting eyes with Flavia has been enough to cause Solveig to pass out from sheer bliss. \nDespite her rather unhealthy obsession, Solveig is still a shrewd woman who once held a prominent position within the underworld. Her readiness to leave that life behind stems from more than just her fixation on Flavia, though—when it comes to cutting ties and starting over, Solveig is as experienced as it gets. Born into a noble family, Solveig endured all manner of abuse throughout her childhood, eventually transforming from a kind, bright little girl into a harsh, vengeful woman unable to fully control her temper or impulses. But all of this changed the day she lost to Flavia. As the instructor showed just how vast the gulf between their abilities truly was, Solveig realized she had been wrong—that great people truly did exist in this world. \nWith that, the scars that had been carved into her heart for so long finally began to heal, and Solveig found a new purpose in life: to use her knowledge and power to assist Flavia in any way she could. \nWhen Flavia left Firbolg Academy, Solveig was naturally right behind her, and it has been largely thanks to her connections in the underworld that the two have remained off the empire's radar for so long—a fact that brings Solveig no end of pride and joy.",
    "14468": "According to the teachings of the Novan Order, man was created by God, whose temple sits among the stars. Only when the stars align can the frail and helpless humanity hope to catch a glimpse of the temple—a miracle only made possible thanks to the guidance of the head priest, who is believed to be an agent appointed by God in order to convey his will. Within the order are numerous factions and forces, but few are as dedicated to the cause as the Sisters of War, of which Serenity is a member.\nEven among the most devout, Serenity is a true zealot. She firmly believes that the pains and troubles she has suffered are trials given to her by God, and that if she can only pass these trials, she will surely hear his voice. So she covers her eyes with a strip of cloth and willingly bears all that her path can throw at her.\nTo her, everything—even the vicious bloodshed of war—happens according to the will of God. Everything save for devil worshipers, that is.\nHer gentle personality is completely turned on its head when it comes to devil worshipers, and the only way to calm her down is for the targets of her wrath to show a willingness to repent. Should they insist on continuing their ways or further insulting the Novan Order, she will eliminate them through the method most familiar to her as a Sister of War: the spilling of blasphemers' blood.\nShe also sees the Empyrean faith as a heretical cult.\n",

Her capabilities shine most when it comes to matters of commerce and scientific research, but her elite education has made her a truly superior and well-rounded individual whose slightest gestures exude an aura of elegance. She is a proud, yet understanding young lady who can analyze a problem calmly and quickly arrive at the best course of action.\nUnfortunately, none of this gets around the fact that she has a rather serious father complex—she always strives to meet his expectations, and gives him full credit for who she is today.\nAs a noblewoman, she has connections with many of the upper-class personnel of Arita, including Morgan herself. But there is one person even the elegant Pandora can't handle: Aita, a powerful individual who exists beyond the borders of elegance and education. If Pandora were to ever be as uncouth as to name someone as her archenemy, Aita would be it. Simply put, Pandora would prefer she disappears from her sight. Forever.",

Even setting aside the impressive size of the Derrian army, Eloise has proven herself an exceptional leader and pilot. Her talents on the battlefield and incredible ability to command her forces her led her army to countless victories—earning the approval of even the loftiest members of the empire's royal families.\nEloise and Krista were both born in the slums of the empire and depended on each other for survival while growing up. Together, they managed to climb through the ranks of the military, becoming leading figures in the country that had once looked down on them.\nBut while the two have reached similar positions, their styles could not be more different; where Eloise practices caution and economic usage of her resources to achieve victory, Krista enthusiastically throws entire armies at her problems. As they have gotten older, even their likes and dislikes have become all but irreconcilable.\nThrough it all, though, Eloise has remained a kind and compassionate individual with a strong love for children—a fondness Krista in no way shares. Still, Eloise may never have adopted Bernadette otherwise. Now that Bernadette has grown into a rebellious young woman however, Eloise finds herself at a loss with both her and Krista. She is as fond as ever of both of them, but things are undeniably awkward.\nBeing a caring person, Eloise has done what she can to help Margaret stay safe as a fugitive of the empire. When word of this got out, a certain group of nobles declared her a threat to their power. Still, Eloise is determined to do what she believes is right.",
    "15274": "Although Trida's exact origins are a mystery, she has always done everything she could to assist and support her friend Curtess. The two founded Moonside, and—recognizing Trida's abilities and trusting her implicitly—Curtess left the majority of its day-to-day management to her. As a result of Trida's leadership, the company has become an industry leader in the fields of energy and transportation.\nAs an executive of Moonside, Trida is both cool-headed and distant—so much so that even Curtess sometimes has difficulty getting her to open up.\nWhile her expression remains stoic even when talking to Curtess, her cold exterior hides a warm and honest heart that can reveal itself at surprising moments. Without missing a beat, Trida can go from talking about potential clients to making rather daring suggestions of what the two of them should do that evening. Naturally, it took a while for Curtess to realize Trida was being sincere. But after spending so much time together, she came to trust that even the most surprising statements were spoken from the heart. Curtess still tends to blush whenever this happens, though.\nThe second person to truly enter Trida's life was Curtess's adopted daughter. Aside from Curtess, Trida never imagined she could care about someone so much, let alone drive the other person away with her clinginess, but that's exactly what happened. No matter how hard she tries, she is like a flower high atop a mountain peak—beautiful, yet distant.",

While her love for her country is unrivaled, her passion for grand adventures and complete lack of aptitude for the work leave something to be desired. Still, when she asked her coddling mother for permission to become a spy, she was immediately granted a meeting with Miroa, who (knowing full well the kind of headache that Polar would bring) did her best to give the girl a relatively easy job—infiltrate Arita's First Order and steal enemy intelligence.\nAfter three years, Polar has accomplished absolutely nothing as a spy—and if possible, she could even be said to have accomplished less than nothing. In that time, she not only failed to provide the empire with any useful information, but actually helped advance Arita's weapons development by accidentally finding a new use for nuclear reactant, significantly increasing the output for rail guns and making the development and utilization of stellar energy possible.\nStill, as a member of the First Order of Arita, she fits in astonishingly well. While she might have originally done it simply to gain their trust, her genuine friendliness and cheery attitude have made her into something of a mascot for numerous research teams. It's possible that on some level, Polar has forgotten what her original mission even was, but her habit of keeping a journal means she might have quite the treasure trove of valuable intel—that is, if she can somehow remember it's there.\nTo maintain her pride as a spy, Polar secretly carries all kinds of weapons. Unfortunately, her fear of pointy objects means she rarely ever uses them. To make matters worse, her clumsiness often causes her to trip, dropping them everywhere, injuring herself, and making her fear of pointy objects that much worse.",

She claims to be an alien from the star 128.133.4685, where she's a university student who's about to graduate. In order to become a civil servant of the Space Administration, Minazuki was sent on a mission to study this planet's biodiversity. To help Minazuki on her mission, she has certain powers—specifically, control over electrical appliances and the ability to brainwash others. Apparently, she adopted the name Minazuki (\"June\" in Japanese) because that's when she arrived on this planet. For the same reason, June is what she put down as her birthday while filling out the academy's registration forms. Whenever she talks, her words are followed by a peculiar beeping sound—apparently created when sending data back to her home planet.\nAs if that wasn't enough, Minazuki claims that the two antenna-like objects on her head are unique to her kind. \nWhile her ability to control electronics and mechs is easily demonstrated, it's unknown if her antennae have anything to do with this—or if they even do anything at all. Someone once tried to expose her by pulling the antennae out, resulting in a horrific amount of blood gushing out of her head. Despite that, Minazuki calmly picked up her antennae and slotted them back in place, stopping the bleeding. Unsurprisingly, no one has tried this a second time.\nMinazuki lives with her father. When asked how an alien happens to have a father on this planet, she says her father is just someone she brainwashed to take care of her. For his part, he happily provides his \"daughter\" with everything she needs to live a comfortable daily life and focus on her work. Despite how it might seem, Minazuki does truly love humans, and enjoys making new friends—though it does take her a while, since so much of what she says is so difficult for others to believe. She's also started watching anime since arriving here, which may or may not be contributing to an already wild imagination. As it stands, the only topic she can really talk about with her classmates is food—and even then, she has some rather peculiar tastes.",

The key to this is her ability to multi-task—she can listen to multiple reports simultaneously and immediately understand not only their intricacies, but how to respond best to each. All of this has led some to refer to her as the One-Woman Super Council, which—while a mouthful—she accepts with a slightly bemused smile.\nWhen not busy running Arita, Morgan likes to fish at a nearby pond. She's developed a technique that allows her to catch an incredible number of fish in what little free time she gets, and even keeps records of her catches.\nFishing grants her some peace and quiet, but when on the clock she is more than capable of working and talking nonstop for an entire day... at least, as long as she has a glass of water by her side.",

Thanks to her position in Kegha's underworld, the empire itself is forced to recognize her authority, making her as influential as even the most prominent nobles.\nImperia rules Black Jester with an iron fist—implementing a strict code of conduct and expecting utter discipline from its members. Those who can follow the rules are richly rewarded, but failure—even at the smallest level—is always punished painfully...and often permanently. Because it regularly weeds out its weakest members, however, Black Jester is an exceptionally resilient organization.\nAs for Imperia, her cunning and ruthlessness lead her to employing methods that are matched in brilliance only by their aggressiveness and cruelty. She is known, on occasion, to \"spice things up\" for her own amusement by inciting conflict with officials or other organizations. As a result, Imperia's name is spoken with dread by all within the empire. If the public knew about her ever-growing collections of military weapons and dangerous pets—with massive snakes in particular being her favorite—her name would likely become synonymous with terror itself.\nBut even the most terrible of villains take days off, and Imperia likes to spend hers visiting black markets in search of new items to add to her collections. The trips have put her into regular contact with Lilith, leading the two to be on rather good terms. Additionally, the funding Haela provided Black Jester during its infancy is now being repaid, with Black Jester supporting Paranoid from behind the scenes.\n",

Since after the Sundering, it was her predecessors that utilized great political strategies and turned Kegha into the strongest country it is today, and as its current ruler, Lilian has fully displayed the intellect and strong mind that is passed down to her, something a queen should possess.\nHaving been subjected to Lisa's teaching since she was born, she grew up with ambition to conquer the world, but her dreams were soon nipped in the bud as Kegha continuously lost its battles against other states. So far, she's had to endure her life as the ruler in peace and pass time by playing chess, one of her few hobbies apart from reading; though her reading lists only contain books about politics and politicians' biographies.\nAs for Lilian's custom-made throne, no one seems to be able to explain its origin, and there's no proof to verify any version despite the rumors going around.",

Her fame began when she alone fought and destroyed the second largest mercenary team, earning herself the name 'Steel Witch' as she'd wear a witch's costume piloting the mech. Owing to her great leadership, she soon built a small mercenary team named Hexel, and from there, she gradually took over other organizations and eventually established her own nation, without much resistance.\nHer congenial nature and the loyalty she displays for her friends have won her the support of her subordinates, as everyone feels comfortable speaking to her despite her position, although her greatness as a leader also lies in how incredibly well and fast she executes a plan.\nHer unique style in battle looks like she's casting magic spells from a distance, although nobody knows whether she's using magic or she's changed the projectile effects into a similar style; one of her hobbies is to stay home researching dark magic, but not much detail is known so far.\n",

To pass the time, Leangle would always work out at the gym, which is one of her few hobbies.\nDespite her excellent performance in the military, she still worries how to make her team members get along: Garren and Blade are always fighting, Chalice's mind is hard to read, even though the four of them can coordinate well when piloting the giant combined mech. \"But this isn't enough,\" Leangle would think to herself. It seems there's still a long way ahead for her to become a great captain.",

    "21795": "So that's it, I failed!",

    "21808": "You really need to work out more, captain.",
    "21809": "I don't wish to keep lowering my expectations for you, captain.",
    "21810": "Short-legged dogs really are the cutest.",
    "21811": "Ah... I guess, I can't handle spicy food.",
    "21812": "Garren's always like that, she never takes work seriously.",
    "21813": "How may I be of service to you?",
    "21814": "You can tell me if you're in trouble, I'm sure we can work it out together.",
    "21815": "I still remember clearly the time we spent working together, and I'll keep it as the most precious memory in my heart.",
    "21816": "It's no time to relax yet, I have to keep working.",
    "21817": "It is your birthday, captain, and the only day I allow you to take a break.",
    "21818": "Let's get to work.",
    "21819": "On my way.",
    "21820": "Mission starts now.",

    "21840": "This place isn't bad for a base.",
    "21841": "Don't judge a book by its cover, captain.",
    "21842": "Um, maybe I need new headphones...",

    "21844": "I don't like people who judge you by your looks.",

    "21848": "Oh? That's an appealing suggestion, but I've already decided to marry black metal.",
    "21849": "Am I going to laze around all day here too?",
    "21850": "Happy birthday, captain. Here, it's a live concert ticket, as my present.",
    "21851": "Time to get to work.",
    "21852": "Hope it's nothing too complicated.",
    "21853": "I'll make it quick.",

Therefore, she is biased against Pandora, but at the same time, she recognizes the ability of the other party. That's why every time she comes across Pandora, the mood is very complex. Although both of them are ladies, Mirabelle apparently lacks manners compared to Pandora. Also, every time she initiates a challenge to Pandora, she always fails, so she couldn't help resenting her a little bit. Pandora, on the other hand, appreciates Mirabelle's abilities and has publicly admitted that she couldn't had built an entire enterprise like Mirabell did. And if Mirabelle could care less about her opponent's opinions so much and just keeps doing her own thing, she would be perfect. Mirabelle is also very aware of her flaws, but it's a pity that her innate personality makes it hard for her not to care about these things.\nMirabelle is a typical domineering and arrogant lady.\nShe participated in the last imperial invasion war, but few know about it.\nMirabelle loves swimming and sailing.

She used to be very observant and concerned about other people's thoughts and feelings, but deep inside there was a side of her longing for freedom. One day, she decided to change and had tried an exercise to get over this weakness. At first, she only used it as a pretence of escaping reality. Eventually, it took her 5 years to become mentally powerful. Since then, the old Coral no longer exists.\nThe person who's been her biggest support during this self-improvement journey was her best friend Evelynn. To exercise one's inner strength does not mean that one has to become independent or smart. If one does not have any friends, it will eventually be a lonely path, and her heart will become more vulnerable and sensitive due to loneliness.\nAlthough Coral became mentally stronger, she didn't realize just how reliant she was on Evelynn. Maybe she was still a long way from being truly powerful. As one of the humans who participated in the digitization project, Coral immediately began to look for Evelynn after her successful process. But on the way, she learned that Evelynn had integrated with a virus. Still, she did not give up on searching for her, collecting leads and trying various methods to save her best friend.\nAs time passed by, the humans in the Digital Realm had gradually lost all the memory of being real humans. Some people had even experienced insanity. Therefore, several government officials proposed a plan to return all humans to the real world. The proposal was eventually rejected, but as a compromise, the plan of recovering human senses was implemented. The content of the plan was to catch humans in the real world and perform various sensory experiments on them and record data to heal those who have lost the senses. However, the real purpose of this experiment was to find one of the pathogens of the virus Evelynn in the real world, that is, the original pathogen, the Evelynn who has been with the captain. Knowing the truth, Coral began to obstruct the plan in secret.\nAfter being caught by the enemy once, Coral got to know another Evelynn's pathogen and they managed to escape together.

She carries herself with confidence and deals with everything with ease, even when she's on the front line she still manages to maintain elegance. However, Calamus is terribly sloppy in private. \nWhen work doesn't call, Calamus never goes out, she simply rots away in her bed all day, let alone doing housework or tidying up. If look closely, you can most certainly find her unwashed underwear from two months ago in her laundry basket, dirty dishes from two weeks ago in the sink, and overturned drink on the table from two days ago. \nEven so, Calamus never reflects on her life style, instead she's always keen to find a way around doing anything herself. Recently, she's been trying to talk the Designers' Family into developing a housework robot and putting it into testing at her own home.",
